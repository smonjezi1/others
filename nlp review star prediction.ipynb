I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.\",\n",

I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.So far so good.We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.The kalamari came first and it was ok. Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service.\",\n",

Now I am well aware of the number of bones that a whole Walleye contains and cannot in any way hold the Beach House responsible for that.

       " \"I got a Groupon for here for my fiancee and mine's anniversary, and we finally were able to get there a month later.  The restaurant was super easy to find and I loved how it was right on the lake.  I spent a lot of time the last few summers in northern WI on a lake, so it was nice to be back on a lake again- brought back good memories!  We did not make a reservation, so it was an hour wait for a table when we arrived.  We hung out in the slightly crowded bar and had a few drinks while we were waiting.  The drinks were good and the bartenders were attentive, so no complaints there!  We were seated at a table that had a great view of the lake.  They had lots of specials going on that night (Friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds.  Delish!  They had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers.  I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon.  I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!  Our server was attentive all night, even though the restaurant was super busy all night.  By the time we left, I was very full and satisfied.\",\n",

I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.  Plus, they put so many croutons in the soup, I was only actually afforded about two small spoonfuls of soup before the liquid was soaked up.  I ordered the bluegill for my main dish.  Being an avid fisherman, I can appreciate some good Wisconsin bluegill.  This bluegill, however, was not good.  It was cold and tasted very old.  The fries that went along with it were also extremely salty.  A couple people in the group said their food was okay, but definitely not worth a trip back.  I was quite bummed about this.',\n",

The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\\n\\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\\n\\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \\n\\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\\n\\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.

I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\\n\\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return.

The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\\n\\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\\n\\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

I suspect the quality of the ingredients has come down a notch. \\n\\nAfter cream cheese wontons, Pad Thai is one of my favorite Asian entrees. My last order looked like Goldilocks\\'s porridge in the \"Three Little Bears\" Golden Book I had as a kid. Dull gray, soupy, greasy, salty and watery, yet somehow sticky. The chopped peanuts added no crunch at all, which is too bad because other than the chicken pieces I picked through the mess to find, I was hoping to find something else edible. Epic fail on this entree. \\n\\nOn my next visit, I ordered the Firecracker noodles with chicken, as a side to my beloved wontons. Slight improvement from last time but still salty as the Dead Sea and enough grease to de-squeak every door hinge on the west side. The bag was so heavy I skipped my biceps workout for a week. The red peppers had no life left. Again, I hunted and pecked for the chicken, which is consistently decent-quality, well-prepared white meat.

       " \"At its best the Bristled Boar is a great place to go with friends for an after-work drink or three, and maybe a game of pool or darts or just watch the game.  At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \\n\\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\\n\\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.\",\n",

I had a nice conversation with some locals and enjoyed a few local brews that were a perfect end to a long day. \\n\\nSo next time you're in the neighborhood, come check this place out and give a nod to the stuffed boar head on the wall, it's seen a lot more action than pretty much everyone.\",\n",

It's not so bad, but it's just not that good.\\n\\nI think everything is frozen at this place. Everything. We had pizza there the other night and I could taste the freezer burn. We still had a blast, but it would be nice if the food wasn't so obviously frozen. Everything is ordered from the bar, which is fine but a little weird.\\n\\nThere isn't too much to say about this place other than what I've just said.

Go to Gino\\'s a mile away if you\\'re craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.

All new equipment and works great. \\n\\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \\n\\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \\n\\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\\n\\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\\n\\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot.

Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight.

One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.\\n\\nAfter a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\\n\\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\\n\\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\\n\\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.\",\n",

None of us had ever been there.\\nWhile the food overall wasnt the WORST I\\'ve had, I wouldnt recommend eating there unless someone buys your meal for you, or youve been stranded on a desert island for 5 years and this is the first \"real\" meal you\\'ve had in ages.  To some, it may make you want to go back to the island...atleast food is fresh.\\n\\nWe arrived 10 mins after the 4 other people of our party, after 20 more minutes the waiter came back to see what we wanted to drink.  Forgot to note, for a Friday night at 7:30 the place was pretty much empty in the dining area.\\n\\nI ordered a diet pepsi and the others ordered random alcoholic drinks.  My soda was flat, watery and had some kind of scum on top of it.  I thought I may be crazy, so everyone at the table tried the soda and agreed it was disgusting.  Waiter came back and I asked for a diet dew instead.  Received a diet dew that tasted a little less flat.....but now the glass had a leak in it while went everywhere.  Asked for a glass from the bar w diet pepsi.  It seemed a little less flat, but not by much.  Atleast that glass was clean.\\nFriend ordered the hog heaven, bloody mary with bacon infused vodka.  He said it wasnt the worst drink, but mainly tasted like greasy bacon fat, not a smokey bacon flavor.  Didnt try it myself.\\n\\nAfter the soda ordeal, it had been 20 mins since we arrived I ordered some Moo-skis as an appetizer, which are listed as hashbrowns covered in bacon, onion, and cheese from what i remember.\\n20 mins after that waiter came back to take our order.  I gave him my order of all you can eat fish and asked about the appetizer.  He said \"oh ya, forgot about those, theyll be right up.\"\\n5 or 6 minutes later, he came back to check our drink status, and said \"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaand.....you had moo-skis.....theyll be here soon.\"\\n5 or 6 mins later again he brought out the moo-skis.\\n\\nThey were hashbrowns on a small side plate with a small layer of shredded mozza on top.  Very plain and greasy tasting.  Realized there should be bacon and onion...which i found tiiiiny few far between pieces inside hash later.  For the 3 or 4 dollars, would have been better used for just plain hashbrowns at a diner for a dollar.\\n\\nFinally get the all you can eat fish which had 2 pieces of pollock, beer battered fries, tartar, and coleslaw:\\nFish: ok sized. breading was hard(which i like), taste ok. Not worst Ive had, but no where near good.\\nFries: Were best part of the meal.\\nTartar: Different, paprika or something in it for a red color.  didnt taste any dill.\\nColeslaw:  Im not sure you could even call this slaw.  It was literally a small cup of mayo, with maybe 2 tiny forks of cabbage.  Im not exaggerating that it was a little liquidy...it was literally SOUP.\\n\\nOrdered a 2nd piece of fish which I got 5 mins later w more tartar.\\n\\nWe were still eating and I ordered a 3rd piece of fish.\\nHe came back with our checks after 10 mins.  We laughed that the forgetting of the fish was on par w our night.  2 friends paid seperate and we had 2 parties of 2.  Super simple orders, but he ended up bringing the bills up wrong 3 times so we had to continue to correct.  Had to take our payments one at a time which added another 10 mins.\\n\\nFinishing up our bills........and kitchen staff brings me the last piece of fish about 30 mins after ordering it and when we were getting up.\\n\\nMaybe it was a one time bad experience, but considering how dead it was on a friday night....Im guessing our experience is pretty representative of the food/wait staff which is a shame since the place really has a nice flair or feel inside it.\\n\\nThe best part of the experience was the upbeat classic 80s music.\\n\\nWe  all received buy one get one coupons upon leaving.  Not sure if it was just us or everyone gets them.\\n\\n30 mins after getting home, I spent lots of time in the bathroom as it all came rushing out the bottom pipes.  I have an iron stomach and don\\'t get messed up by much.\\n\\ngirlfriend edit:  Reminded me she didnt get the salad she ordered and had to ask.

To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb. Tends to indicate a reliance on seasonal (and hopefully locally grown) produce. \\n\\nIt being Father's day, they had a special on Steak and Eggs and a fresh berry topped waffle special too.

Those are some of my favorite memories, and to this day I get a rush of excitement just walking in to the place when I get that first waft...  It really is the best outside of the Gulf.\\n\\nI really can't even start on what my favorites are because every time I pick something off the menu it becomes my new favorite.  The po' boys are without exception great.  The roast beef was my first love, and I keep coming back to this one.  The French bread is perfect - crisp and the perfect texture for the sandwich.  It took me a while to try the fried oyster po' boy - I was not so adventurous as a kid - but after trying this I see why this is my mother's favorite.  The Gulf shrimp and the fried chicken are incredible.  This place is a 5 star easily on the strength of the po' boys alone, but the rest of the menu is not to be skipped.  The jambalaya is great for those that can't take too much heat, and even better with a bit of Tabasco for those that can.  The shrimp creole - HOO BOY!  Spicy but not excessive, it has enough heat to get you sweating and the flavors are spot on.  Same for the shrimp etouffee.  The red beans & rice with double sausage is my all-time favorite comfort food.  Most of the time I can't make up my mind, so I hit up the Mardi Gras combo, which gives you all three.  Perfection!  And it all comes with a piece of cornbread to finish it all off.  \\n\\nI've only been to the Fordem location, though there is another on Monroe Street.  I'm certain that had I not graduated prior to this location opening I would have made it a regular destination.  As it is, I love coming down Sherman then Fordem, and you're suddenly right there looking at the mural on the side of the building.  I call ahead whenever I plan to stop, but about half the time it is straight up impulse that brings me there.  No matter whatever else happens that day, it's always a good day if you've been to New Orleans Take Out.\",\n",

       " 'Quick Review: If it weren\\'t for the stellar fish fry and the awesome beer selection, this place would be a solid 2.5-star establishment.  Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison\\'s finest.\\n\\nDetailed Review:\\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter\\'s Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \\n\\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I\\'m sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \\n\\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn\\'t a problem.  Dexter\\'s recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \\n\\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could\\'ve been a little warmer.  I\\'m told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.\\n\\nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he\\'d be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  \\n\\nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter\\'s doesn\\'t strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \\n\\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \"from the bag\" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.\\n\\nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.  Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that\\'s what we\\'re talkin\\' about.  The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful.  The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored.  I loved every single bite of it.\\n\\nI also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well.  Huge props to Dexter\\'s for their fish fry - it\\'s definitely a top-10 offering.\\n\\nIn the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp\\'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under $40.  We tipped well and called it a night.  I\\'d definitely go back to Dexter\\'s - sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us.  Thanks, Dexter\\'s!!\\n\\nDexter\\'s = WIN\\n\\nFood = 4.5 stars (excellent fish; curds and fries were stellar)\\nService = 2 stars (they forgot about us, but made up for it)\\nValue = 2 stars (would\\'ve been over $85 for the 4 of us)\\nMisc = 3 stars (the place isn\\'t much to look at, but has an excellent beer selection...)\\n\\nOh - also, parking is hard to come by, so be prepared to park on the street and/or walk a bit to get there.',\n",

I was full when I finished the 1/4 of their huge serving portion. \\n\\nGood mix of crowd. Kids, 20-somethings, old and all. I shall be back there to sample more beer and heckle at Olympic games on a TV screen.\",\n",
       " \"I wanted fish fry last night, but we didn't feel like driving, so we figured we'd give Dexter's a try. (It's 3 blocks from our house.) \\n\\nMy first impression was that this place doesn't belong in Madison - it belongs somewhere much farther north. There was an awesome mix of people there, which is always a good sign for me. They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders. My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great. I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection.\\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries. Our food was AMAZING. This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far. The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro. I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome. I'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic, though, so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover.\\n\\nI am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house. We will definitely be going back soon.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been frequenting Dexter\\'s quite often over the past few months (to the tune of around twice per week) and am happy to report that every visit has been absolutely STELLAR.\\n\\nThere\\'s the obviously excellent beer selection - it\\'s constantly rotating, and it always tastes fresh and wonderful.  The staff really know their beer - if you ever have a question, don\\'t hesitate to ask because they will offer a sample, suggestions, and plenty of information.\\n\\nThe food has been incredible with every visit.  Sure bets: the hummus platter (wow, that IPA hummus is unreal), the waffle fries, any of the burgers, most of the specials, and of course, the fish fry.\\n\\nI\\'ve had several burgers (The Abbey (with tomato garlic sauce), the Defibrillator (onions, ham, bacon, egg, cheese), and the Patty Melt) - each was delicious, and they cook them exactly to order.\\n\\nI\\'ve had the Santa Fe Chicken salad - wow, those roasted veggies are great.  The soups have also been excellent - I recently had the spicy vegetable and the chili; the chili features a spice that slowly crescendos - by the end of the cup, you\\'re feeling a little of that capsaicin love.\\n\\nI\\'ve had several specials, including a turkey melt and a loaded ham and cheese.\\n\\nAnd of course, I\\'ve had the fish fry several more times and am PLEASED to report that it remains excellent.  The hearty, perfectly applied batter and the flaky fresh cod is among Madison\\'s best.  I will be updating my fish fry review with new pictures and details in the near future.\\n\\nService has markedly improved - the staff is fast, friendly, and as mentioned, super helpful.  I really enjoy their company - it\\'s great to drop by and sit at the bar or to grab a table and chill for a while.\\n\\nUPDATE: Dexters = MAJOR WIN\\n\\nFood = 4.75 stars.

       " \"This has easily become my go-to Friday fish fry.  I like it so much, I've been hesitant to even write this review.  Nonetheless, Dexter's does it right.\\n\\nFresh, Bering sea cod enveloped in a crispy, salty batter keeps me dreaming of Fridays.  The clam chowder is phenomenal and so are the rest of their soups...obviously lovingly tended to and cooked from homemade stocks.  I could further pontificate, but no need...the execution in the kitchen is stellar.  \\n\\nNow, the beer list is exquisite in my opinion.  I love Madison, but many bars get so caught up on local-centric taps lists.  Consequently, more often than not, you walk in to see the taps jammed with Ale Ayslum, Lake Louie and Capital.  Not bad...but I'll be damned to say I could choke down another Hopalicious.  Dexters, on the other hand, opens their taps up to pretty much anything.  From Toppling Goliath (which I love, but you can't really get outside of Iowa and Wisco) to Belgian Flander's Reds, they kill it with their beer selection.  Also, I really respect that they let you know on the beer list what's on deck...this has kept me coming back many-a-times.  \\n\\nSo why not the 5-stars?  Well, we've run into some seriously long waits, both for a table and then for the fish.  If they could streamline a little more in the kitchen, I'd gladly give it that extra star.  In the mean time, we NEVER come here on Fridays after 6pm....forget it.  If you don't mind dining with the Greyhairs....you'll do just fine.\",\n",

We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday in Lent and knew we were already in trouble when parking was hard to find.  The dining room was packed and we were told there would be an hour wait.  Since we had driven across town, we decided to wait it out in the bar.  There is plenty of room to wait and have a beer from the huge selection they have.  In 30 minutes we were called for our table.  Two of us ordered the lake perch and one ordered the deep fried cod.  There is also baked cod, walleye, blue gill and shrimp to choose from.  The fish comes with your choice of  - baked potato, waffle fries, pub fries, homemade potato chips, and some other things like cottage cheese etc.  We had waffle fries, potato chips and the pub fries, which are beer pattered.  You also get a small container of cole slaw and a white grocery store roll.  There was a short wait for our fish, but the dining room was still packed.  When it arrived, it was hot, tasty and a generous serving.  We were all very satisfied with our dinner.  I thought the homemade potato chips were excellent, they came out warm and crispy.  The only thing I did not care for was the tartar sauce, can't place what it was, but had a funny taste to it to me.  Everyone that waited on us was friendly and efficient without being intrusive.  Wish this place was closer to my side of town, but we will definitely try it again.  Get there early or expect to wait!\",\n",

We're told that our meal is comped by 50%, which I'll obviously take, but that nothing was being done about the noise because the manager didn't hear anything.  So my complaint was without merit and the loud group shouldn't have been told that other customers were complaining about the noise they were making?!  What an incompetent manager!  The food was merely meh.  Other than the noise issue, our server was fine.\",\n",

The wifi - I'm guessing in response to a previous review - is now fast enough to handle streaming HD videos. Which is great, because the large CRT tv in my room's cable selection was very limited. To top things off - while they don't have a bar, you can buy bottles of beers for 2 to 2.50 at the front desk. This combined with being right by the highway and reasonable rates would warrant an easy 4 star review. \\nSo - despite cheap beer, free popcorn and fast wifi - they lost the star for the abysmal 'gym'. One old treadmill and one elliptical in a tiny room. So, instead of getting my run in before I had to go to work in the morning, I logged my miles in the surrounding (very pleasant) neighborhood as the sun came up (there's a great hill and a few tiny parks that were fun to run through, large sidewalks and well marked streets). Fortunately, the runs were amazing, and the streets mostly well lit - but I would have been irate had I booked this room in the winter or if it was raining and I was stuck on the tredmill. \\nSo If I'm back in Madison, I'll consider staying here again if the workout facilities are redone and expanded.

I have contemplated a dine and dash many times.  I counted the minutes one time, and it was 45 minutes from the time I finished eating to when the check came.

Believe me, the service being slow is never because there isn't enough servers or too many diners.   \\n\\nThe food is decent, but it's not great by any means. It is still pretty okay, although I've had some bad meals.  The meatless meatloaf is only saved by the cashew gravy, and the salmon cakes are awful.

That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, \"You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don\\'t see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.\"  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.

Take a stroll around if it's a nice day and your bound to find something you like.  If not, I'm sure you probably enjoyed the food as all the dishes I've ever had were great and the portions were generous.\\n\\nThere are a few drawbacks though that held me back from giving a 5 star review.  First, there is usually a very long wait.  The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience.  Secondly, the service is hit or miss.  I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something.  Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing.\\n\\nSetting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed.

Breakfast potatoes were solid and didn't provoke the usual request for Cholula/Tabasco. I appreciated the fact that fresh fruit is offered as a side with most breakfasts. Definitely hit the spot. Our server was very attentive and was exceedingly patient with our sleep-deprived indecision before ordering.\\n\\nAfter glancing at the dessert case filled with ultra-decadent delights (cupcakes, cakes, etc.) I think I'd be up for returning on a future trip to Madison.

I went with the Heathen Vegan Sandwich, which is piled high with mushrooms, tempeh, and avocado.  For my side, I chose the bean salad.  Both of these items were delicious.  The sandwich was HUGE.  I could not eat it like a regular sandwich, so I ate it in an open-faced sort of way with a fork.  A little messy, but totally worth it.  The mushrooms and tempeh were perfectly seasoned and tender and the avocado brought it all together with the toasted bread.\\n\\nI got a bit nervous because at the *very last second* my grandma changed her order to the exact same thing I got (she\\'s not vegan) because she \"trusts me\".  I was pretty nervous, but she ended up loving it!  I was so pleased.  My one complaint might be that my bean salad had a bit too much dressing on it, but my grandma\\'s did not share that problem and it wasn\\'t difficult to just eat it with a fork instead of a spoon.\\n\\nMy grandpa ordered some sort of breakfast platter and was very pleased.  He basically always orders the same thing at diners - two poached eggs, bacon, potatoes, and toast, so if he is impressed I feel that it is a good sign. He said the eggs were cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThey seem extremely accommodating for allergies and preferences as well, which is always a huge plus.\\n\\nOverall, I was very happy with my first visit to Monty\\'s.

Plenty of good vegetarian options also.\\n\\nFood is interesting, with lots of things not found in your typical diner.   Coffee is from Just Coffee (that is a bonus feature people - if you like coffee, this is a great place) and many of the specials are made with organic foods.  Want a burger but don\\'t eat meat?  Swap out the Walnut burger - which, as a meat eater, I can say is good.  Certainly better than their hamburger.  Speaking of which...\\n\\nWhat is up with that hamburger?  First off, it comes medium well done - no burger should ever be cooked to that.  Second, it is heavily, and funky seasoned.  As in, if I ordered it, it would go back.

However my niece who ordered it liked it, so we kept it.\\n\\nDeserts are very popular at Monty\\'s, but that was our disappointment.  Cheesecake was rubbery and the carrot cake was dry - stale dry.

I prefer Home Depot but the prices are so much lower at Menard's.\\n\\nIn the matter of two weeks, all of this happened:\\n\\n1. I bought a can of paint for our guest room.  I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\\n\\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \\n\\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \\n\\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\\n\\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \\n\\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \\n\\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve revisited this Menards countless times over the past few months. Lately, I\\'ve only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that\\'s not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \\n\\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \"No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we\\'ll open additional check-out lanes!\" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\\n\\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they\\'re located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That\\'s outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That\\'s on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It\\'s at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It\\'s in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There\\'s zero organization/logic...\\n\\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\\n\\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn\\'t have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did. A few days ago, I needed a John Guest fitting, which Menards didn\\'t have, but my local Ace Hardware did. \\n\\n+ Holiday sales are usually a good deal, especially for large ticket items like ceiling fans and whatnot.',\n",

       " 'I\\'ve been to the Harmony several times before, but last night was the first time I\\'ve been there for live music, and also the first time I tried their famed Walnut Burger.\\n\\nFirst, you should know that the Harmony is indeed a bar. If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it\\'s ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. \\n\\nAfter fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening\\'s band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you\\'re a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I\\'m told they\\'re famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.\\n\\nOnto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. \\n\\nWe ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn\\'t recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. \\n\\nAll this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They\\'re the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there\\'s probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin\\'. Also, I don\\'t mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night. I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it\\'s crowded. All-in-all, these drawbacks are minor, and I\\'ll be back at The Harmony many times this summer!',\n",

Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow. In comparing two other bikes stores, their sale prices were still more than Village Peddler everday prices, can you say mark-up!\\n\\nEach of the boys were taught how to assemble and dissasemble their tires making sure to check the brakes to allow them for a seamless ride.Gary went over this a couple times to make sure the boys were comfortable to do it on there own, then asked them both to do it by themselves. After about two times, they are pros! I was impressed as I sat back and watched the interaction between the boys, Gary, and newly joining in on the conversation; Mike. It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional.

I think they stock 4 or 5 of those, and when they\\'re gone, they\\'re gone (they\\'re also about $1 higher than Woodman\\'s).\\n\\n- It\\'s inconvenient to get in and out of.  University Avenue S-U-C-K-S sucks.  And, if you wish to head west from Metcalfe\\'s, you have to turn onto Midvale, make a U-turn, and then sit at the Midvale/University light and wait... The parking lot is also a cluster-F.\\n\\n- The checkers can be a bit snooty.

I usually encounter a \"why-are-you-bothering-me-with-this\" sigh or a roll of the eyes at some point during checkout.  \\n\\n- The clientele can be a bit snobby (especially the ones that hop out of their leased BMWs).  Yeah, so you think you\\'re cool in your BMW, but we both know that you\\'re living in a rundown apartment, using one credit card to pay the other, and you\\'re maybe 2-weeks from having the Bimmer repo\\'d.

At WF, the same cereal is $4.99. And then there is the ice cream aisle. One would imagine that this place would carry premium ice cream, being that it kind of touts itself as gourmet. Wrong! It's all garbage. The only semi good brand is Sassy Cow and again, guess what? More than six dollars per container!! The bakery section is gross, too.

Eggs from 40 miles away too far for you? Grab a dozen from the farm that\\'s labeled 8 miles away... no yolk! Care to chomp cheese that doesn\\'t drive more than 5? They\\'ve got it. Add java, pasta sauce even tortilla chips bagged 1 mile down the street at the local taqueria and you have a geographically conscious way to stock pantry fridge and freezer. \\n\\nOh and Chef Lea Caplan...

She worked hard to figure out which local flowers would be available at the time, and as a result we only had to have a few things that were sourced regionally instead of locally - very cool!! \\n\\nThe flowers were all beautifully packaged and well labeled, as well, which made it easy for the folks setting up the morning of.

I\\'ve been here off and on for years, but there was a weird vibe in the air.

Took our drink order, took our order, and left.\\n\\nShe knew we had a baby with us, and knew that she had just taken an order from the table of 8 behind us, and didn\\'t bother to consider bringing the fruit cup for our daughter or my wife and I a basket of fries ahead of time since we\\'d be waiting a bit due to the large ticket in queue ahead of us. She didn\\'t even bother checking on our drink situations in the meantime. Just went all ghost and ignored us.\\n\\nIn this meantime, my wife and I are entertaining our daughter and looking and watching around us. She notices the manager checking in with other tables and rolling her eyes a bit after a few exchanges with customers. I notice a few scoffs and eye-rolls among the staff, and start to get bothered by how the staff is acting like this job is beneath them.\\n\\nAnother server brings us our food. I had asked for a side of sauce that doesn\\'t show up, but she gets it promptly. I had asked for no tomato on the burger, but was talked over so she must not have heard it. No big deal.\\n\\nWe go to serve some fruit to our daughter, but we still don\\'t have any silverware or napkins, so we ask and some are brought reasonably promptly. And set right in front of our 9 month old daughter. Not the brightest of plans to set metal forks and knives in front of any small child, but especially one who is currently fussing a bit at not having any food.\\n\\nAt no point does the manager come by to check on us. Our server barely says another word to us after handing us the bill. They coasted this entire time, why did I expect them to suddenly make any effort? Because I thought they would want us to come back.\\n\\nI\\'m of the belief that if you think your job is beneath you, then you should prove it. You never know who is watching or who you\\'re serving, and who may be able to help you get out of the job that you don\\'t really like. I mean, there are so many places to get a mediocre burger, you may as well offer above and beyond service to make it stand out.\\n\\nI guess when even the manager is rolling her eyes at customers, the rest of the staff begins to believe that kind of behavior is acceptable.',\n",

Selection is limited, however its very convenient. I didn\\'t have much of an opportunity to checkout the outside courtyard due to the snow and extreme cold however it looked like it would provide a great area to relax after a busy day.\\n\\nOverall all the interior hotel property was clean, with a nice comfortable room. The room itself offered me enough room to spread out. Complete with a workspace, sofa, 32\" flat screen tv and a mini fridge. The bathroom was average size, however not too small where you would feel cramped. The staff here was great, from check in to check out and even dining at the bistro everyone went above and beyond to make my stay enjoyable. \\n\\nI already have to return to Madison in a few weeks and have already booked by return trip at this very same hotel.  One complaint I did have was staying on the rear of the hotel is that the garbage pickup provided a nice wakeup call between 6-6:30am twice during my 4 night stay.',\n",

We had adopted our first dog from DCHS a little over a year prior to this and absolutely love her (and yes, spoil her). \\n\\nWe thought the staff handled the introduction of the dogs flawlessly. They let each dog sniff out the room alone, and then had my bf and I watch through windows as they introduced the dogs. They kept the atmosphere positive and free from distractions, while slowly giving them more and more space to interact. The dogs were buddies from the start and have continued to be best friends. \\n\\nOnce again, we were thrilled with the staff and the whole process.

It's definitly the atmosphere that brings all the boot-stomping night owls out en masse.

She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.

Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.

We didn't stay once we were done eating and spent almost 2 1/2 hours at the restaurant!!\\n\\nTruth be told I think Thai Elephant or Papaya Thai are still my favorite thai restaurant.\",\n",
       " \"Living in Chandler I never would have found this place unless I had to meet a friend who was in town staying near by.  I read many reviews and even with many complaining about the service, we gave it a try.\\n\\nFirst upon arriving I was met by a friendly hostess, who offered to get me a beer while I waited for my friend.  When I went to pay she said don't worry, it will be added on your bill. Now I like that in a place!\\n\\nWhen seated our server (huge smile) immediatley was there offering all of us more drinks, so far I find nothing like those that have complained.\\n\\nSince it was a Friday during lent my friend could not have meat so we ordered with our drinks the veg sampler app.  It came and was fantastic and most suprisingly light.  I ordered as a main the seafood panang and it was so good.  The panang sauce had great flavor with a  nice touch of heat on the backside.  None of it remained.  My friend ordrered the mango shrimp and ate every bite of that.\\n\\nFinally anyone who does not have mango and sticky rice at a Thai joint is nuts in my opinion so of course we ordered that.  Just delicious!  \\n\\nSo this place is legit, good service and good food.  I would if I could give it 4.5 stars.\",\n",
       " '4.5 or maybe 4.6\\n\\nFinally got to try Wild Thaiger. By what I have read and now I interpreted the menu, I thought it was just fancy schmancy version of my fave Thai dishes. Since I\\'m not one to mess with classics, I didn\\'t know how I\\'d like this spot. Wifey told me that tonight was the Thai New Year and they were going to have live music and dancers, so I figured uck it why not. What an awesome meal.\\n\\nWe started with the veggie sampler ($12.95) as our appetizer and a big ole $5 Thai beer. The sampler had the corn fritters, veggie egg rolls and tofu in peanut sauce. The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.\\n\\nFor our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce. The ONLY part I didn\\'t totally love was the calamari, it was waaaay chewy. Every other part was perfect. The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they\\'re supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over. \\n\\nThe other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to. I realized a piece of the pork, with some of the sweet carrot salad and the sauce had the total package. Wow. \\n\\nWe ended the meal with a stiff cocktail (I had this cosmo thing with sake, cranberry and lime juice that I had them serve me in a regular cup instead of the martini glass so I didn\\'t look like a nancy) and wifey had a big ole slice of chocolate cake. Triple decker and all.\\n\\nWe ended up leaving around 720 or so, and the music was SUPPOSED to start at 7 but we didn\\'t get to see it. Nevertheless, it was an awesome meal and I\\'m super stoked to have that cool Thai spot within walking/stumbling distance to the casa.',\n",

I don't remember what everyone else had but I know one member of our party got the Thai Iced tea and said it was fantastic.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nWe ordered a bunch of appetizers for the table.\\n\\nDragon Eggs - These pork and crab stuffed dumplings were tender, tasty and served with a mild-tangy dipping sauce.\\n\\nSatay Sampler - Shrimp, beef and chicken skewers marinated in a tasty coconut curry and served with peanut sauce and cucumber chutney. Loved it!\\n\\nWild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.\\n\\nVeggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.\\n\\nHot Pot:\\nWe also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.\\n\\nMain Course:\\nI had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.  Trust me, it was so delicious that I really wanted to finish the whole dish but after all the appetizers and soup I thought I might explode if I didn't stop eating!\\n\\nOnce again, I cant remember what everyone else had but there were no complaints at all.\\n\\nDesert:\\nOMG the Lemon Ginger Cheesecake is to die for!

Decorated with traditional Thai art; Wild Thaiger tries to emulate that Thailand feel along with your cuisine.  \\n\\nI've been here several times once for dinner and once for Happy Hour.  I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.\\n\\nOverall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.

Stupid short bed.\\n\\nIn any case, house keeping were great and we had a nice little view of the surrounding area thanks to our little balcony.  It's also close to the library, old spaghetti factory, an art museum, cafes, etc.  It was also within walking distance to 1st and Roosevelt where they were holding 1st Fridays which is pretty much a block party for the arts.\\n\\nThe location was the best attribute here.

That\\'s a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill.

Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!\\n5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.\\n6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.\\n7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be \"checked out\" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.\\n8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done.

We were staying at the Hyatt Regency on 2nd Street & Monroe, walking distance from the Arizona Center that is blessed with Sam's Cafe! \\nI can be a demanding customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff & chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice & beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)!\\nWe were so pleased with our meal & service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky & tasteful salsa, (I just ran a marathon)! The chips themselves are very unique mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet potato chips, and some other varieties...GOOD! \\nI will return on any visit to Phoenix!!\",\n",

The chips are great- a variety of veggie, tortilla, and won-ton chips mixed in one basket. The tortilla soup, quesadillas, and especially the carnitas plate are all highly recommended. The Orange Beso margarita is so delicious and so big we always split one. The seafood pasta was acceptable, which is almost high praise in Phoenix where most of the seafood we've had is downright nasty. We've never had room for dessert, but the white chocolate/pecan corn husk is the perfect little bit of sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are fair and the outdoor seating is cool, but can be a little loud when they are crowded and the waterfalls are running in the courtyard. The service has always been good to excellent.\",\n",
       " \"This restaurant closes their doors at 10pm SHARP!! My mom and I arrived at the restaurant at 10pm. The hostess planned to close the restaurant. Thank you Manager of the restaurant for letting us stay!!\\n\\nWe basically had 5 minutes to look at the menu. Our waitress wanted us out ASAP. I didn't look at the menu carefully so I just picked something out of the Specialty section. \\n\\nAnyway, the chips and salsa were awesome!!! Our basket of chips had three varieties: corn tortilla, blue corn tortilla, and a sweet and spicy chip. I really liked the sweet and spicy chip since it tasted like a slightly spicy churro. Yum!  The salsa had a black bean flavor and chunks of tomatoes. Also yummy.\\n\\nThe food came out so quickly!! It took like 10 minutes for the food to come out. Haha.\\n\\nI had the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast. mMmMM.. the stuffing was so good!! I loved the herb-goat cheese mixed with the red pepper cream sauce and the cilantro pesto. The chicken was very moist! The asparagus wasn't too good, as it was chewy. However, the southwest rice pilaf was so creamy and had a smoky flavor. I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!\\n\\nMy mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto. The chicken was moist, and the pesto had a deep cilantro flavor. If you hate cilantro, stay away from this dish!! There was a tad bit too much olive oil, but the strong cilantro flavor was awesome!\\n\\nIt was a pleasant surprise to receive a frozen white chocolate tamale. YUMMY! I only eat white chocolate so I was so excited to eat this. Loved the nuts and the sweetness. \\n\\nAgain, our waitress was not very nice to us.

       " 'My two-star rating for Sam\\'s Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I\\'ll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \\n\\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam\\'s Cafe. \\n\\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it\\'s ready so that it doesn\\'t get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn\\'t for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \\n\\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid\\'s and McCormick & Schmick\\'s are two great examples. \\n\\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don\\'t want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I\\'m crazy, but I don\\'t think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you\\'re having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren\\'t (having a good time), so we didn\\'t (order more).',\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed this place. I had some great grilled tuna with rice and veggies. It was cooked perfectly and the seasonings didn't overwhelm the tuna. Everyone else at the table got more traditional mexican dishes...tacos, fajitas etc. and they really seemed to enjoy them! I also had an AMAZING margarita. It was a specialty one with citrus flavors, I don't even like tequila but it was delicious. The outdoor seating area is beautiful. We ate surrounded by trees covered in twinkle lights, so pretty.\",\n",
       " \"After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\\n\\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\\n\\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\\n\\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\\n\\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \\n\\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.\",\n",

The basket of chips included blue corn, yellow corn, sweet potato and surprisingly the best of the bunch, fried won ton skins with Navajo spices. The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.\\n\\nWe started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.\\n\\n I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.\\n\\nAll in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips.

We skipped the appetizer only because we had tickets to a show but not to worry because the complementary chips and salsa are outstanding! You don't even need the salsa as the chips are seasoned, fresh and uniquely delicious. Husband had the chicken quesadilla and inhaled it before I could try it but he loved it. I was torn between the Stuffed Chicken and the Spinach and Portobello quesadilla. I had (and loved) the chicken dish my last visit so I went with the spinach and mushroom quesadilla which was wonderfully simple and delicious with a fresh and tasty salad on the side. We didn't have time for dessert but again, not to worry as the complementary white chocolate nibble they serve at the end of the meal hits the spot. Next time we come to Sam's we will hopefully have more time for appetizer and dessert.

She was very knowledgable about the city and the restaurant which I was surprised to find has a sister cafe in my town (St. Louis). I thought the food was good but not amazing.

       " 'Canyon Cafe has the potential to be an idyllic restaurant, but falls short on nearly all aspects one desires in a dining experience. I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\\n\\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I\\'ve ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\\n\\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \\n\\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn\\'t know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I\\'m not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial \\'foot in the ass\\' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don\\'t have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\\n\\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that\\'s to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn\\'t in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\\n\\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \\n\\nI\\'m about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i\\'d like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I\\'m being rushed out again. I don\\'t touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that\\'s on my table,\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re not finished?\"\\n    No.\\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\\n    ..........\\n\\nI think I\\'m finished now. I\\'m finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school.

It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.\\n\\n- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit\\n\\n- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. \\n\\n- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. \\n\\n- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit.

Feel free to ask a lot of questions. Even try to negotiate prices. You never know, some of those pieces have been there for YEARS! Demand certificates of authenticity. Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they\\'re made out of! \\n\\nThere could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver. And they could both be priced the same. ASK QUESTIONS!! Ask to try to stuff on. They are usually pretty nice about this, except when it comes to earrings. Many hard to find books can be found here. Whenever someone is doing a research project, the Heard is one of the first places I recommend. I recommend the photography books.\\n\\nTheir exhibits are always changing.

She believes and knows that all the pieces are authentic at the Heard\\'s Gift Shop. \\n\\nShe has said and I quote: \"Hi Cher, Deb K. here--actually, I do work at the Heard and I can tell you that everything that we sell is authentic.\"  and she even goes on to say, \"Maybe you\\'re thinking about those dreamcatchers and whatnots in the back? Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment.

The Heard is the premier launching pad for non-natives in this city to experience Indian Country but sometimes it comes at a price. We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it\\'s allowed and it\\'s a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. \\n\\nThere is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O\\'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O\\'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don\\'t complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it\\'s nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I\\'m so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.\\n\\nLike I said - it\\'s a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it\\'s an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be \"let in\" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we\\'re obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.\\n\\nTo my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it\\'s own ways and unique culture.

We had an excellent tour guide who was part Navajo and part Hopi. In addition to giving us a broad overview of Native American history, he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions. As we toured through the galleries filled with basketry, ceramics, and Navajo blankets, he explained that a lot of the names \"given\" to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another. For instance, the Pima tribe is so called because in response to the question, \"What are you called?\" the people answered, \"Pima,\" which means \"I don\\'t know\"--as in, I don\\'t know what you crazy people are asking me!\\n\\nMy friend and I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend visiting if you\\'re ever in Phoenix.',\n",

Interactive. The Heard created great displays with information and an interactive game for children...or children at heart. \\n\\n2. Visual dessert for the eyes. They don\\'t cheat you on historical artifact exhibits which shows that they have a nice group of donors who are eager to keep the museum alive and visually stimulating. \\n\\n3. Family-fun for everyone. I saw a brochure marketing family-fun days every Saturday in July. Activities include, interactive games, crafts, live performances, etc. \\n\\n4. AZ Resident Friendly. The admission price was $12 and I cringed a little, but then as if I was meant to get a little cultured that day, they told me that AZ residents receive free admission every second Sunday of the month. Not a bad way to take care of the residents melting in the heat! \\n\\n5. Cafe food you actually want to eat. To make the most of the day, I ate at the cafe and took advantage of the 85 degree weather while it still lasted. The food...was good. I had a warm turkey and brie sandwich on homemade cranberry bread with the corn pasta salad.

Turns out most apache don't like him.\\n\\nOutside of a history text book, native american culture can be difficult to study.  It also doesn't help that most presentations of american indian history just make me feel guilty about what our government did to their ancestors decades and centuries before my family even immigrated to the country.  While the Herd Museum doesn't completely avoid this feeling, it does try its best not to shove it in your face.\\n\\nThe $15 dollar admission isn't too bad.  Free parking was an unexpected treat.

They need to provide some sort of microphone system for the docents to speak to their tours; they are available.  The first docent who, I discovered later, is new and still in training, had a problem with her speed.  She would start explaining about a particular room or exhibit before the entire group was within hearing distance--and about the time the last people came near enough to hear her, she was off to the next exhibit.  \\n\\nPhotography is allowed in the museum; however, some of the exhibits and explanatory walls are covered with a reflective glass or plex which reflects the light from behind, making photography difficult.\\n\\nThe prices in the sit-down restaurant are very very very expensive - They are quite appropriate for a dinner, but for a lunch at a venue which is pricey to enter in the first place, an overpriced sandwich isn't appropriate.  Even the hot dog combo in the cantina was $7!  Why does every facility of this type add to the cost of the enjoyment of the place by offering overpriced food?\\n\\nThe building and grounds are gorgeous, and quite an oasis in the middle of a busy city.

I\\'m from NY and it was my first time in Phoenix, so I definitely made sure I went to hear what the buzz in town was all about.\\n\\nThe museum is free on Wednesdays! I ended up going on a Tuesday, so I just paid the full price admission of $16. I figured, hey...why not! I\\'m not going to be here again for awhile.\\n\\nI learned so much about the lifestyle of all the different Native American reservations in Arizona and across the US. From the Navajo to the Hopi tribes, the pottery they make to the garments they wore, the Heard Museum was a mind-blasting educational experience! There was definitely too much information for me to absorb in one day, which is why I would go back again if I were ever in Phoenix.\\n\\nThe gift shop is pricey! I wanted to buy a souvenir, perhaps a piece of unique jewelry, but all the ones that caught my eye were in the $200+ range. Regardless, the knowledge I gained walking out of the museum was priceless!\\n\\nThe most disturbing moment for me was learning about how these Native Americans were pushed out of their lands and forced to live as \"civilized\" beings. This particular exhibit is located on their 2nd floor and did a great job in making me feel uncomfortable. \\n\\nThey endured torture and were forced to lose their long hair, their traditional clothing, their identity...denied the right to be who they are. Sound familiar? Sound like the racism slaves endured in the South? Well, nothing I read or hear will ever allow me to fully understand what these individuals dealt with, and probably still deal with, but knowing and understanding that this exists only makes me love the strength of the Native Americans.\\n\\nAll I can learn are what the pages of textbooks taught us in history class, but now that I am out of school, a museum has a way of retelling stories of the past on a whole other level. \\n\\nThe best part was connecting the dots about Arizona. I went to the Grand Canyon prior to my excursion in Phoenix, and I realized that a lot of the different locations in the Grand Canyon are named after these Native American tribes. \\n\\nI love me some education! ;)',\n",

There are a number of permanent exhibits and they change things up a bit every so often to give you a good reason to return. Visit their website to see what's going on.  I don't know how many artifacts and pieces of Native American and Southwest art they have in their collection, but it's certainly in the thousands.  As you stroll through the museum to see the displays and read a bit about the history you can't help but put yourself in the time period and imagine what life must have been like.\\n\\nIf you're visiting the Phoenix area from a location that doesn't have something like the Heard and you want to go home with some knowledge of Native American and Southwest art I highly recommend a visit to Heard.\",\n",

I appreciated the level of detail, references, and artifacts throughout the museum.  The museum has a wealth of info...both historical and contemporary.  However, all tribes arent represented equally throughout the museum, which is cool but it will be helpful to understand why.\\n\\nThere are also several interactive games throughout the museum to engage in.  \\n\\nIn terms of layout, I thought the museum did not have a good flow or at least it was a little difficult to understand the flow.  While touring the museum, I often wondered \"where do I go next\" or \"what\\'s the premise of this section\".\\n\\nBut that shouldn\\'t stop you from visiting this great facility.\\n\\nThey have free admission on Sundays in July which will get you into every part of the museum except for the Lego exhibit.\\n\\nCheck it out!',\n",

The bartenders are personable and charming and it's not unusual for one of them to grab the mic and wander the restaurant singing karaoke (and singing it well).

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.\",\n",

I had made reservations for us and when we got to the restaurant they informed us it would just be a few more minutes and that we could take a seat at the bar.The bartender was very nice and intuitive, he noticed I was eying up the pickled mushrooms and gave me some for my cocktail.A few minutes later we were promptly seated so the wait was not long at all.We were seated at a nice table by the window with a view of the lake.So far so good.We ordered a kalamari appetizer to share, three beer battered cod fish fry dinners and one breaded shrimp dinner.The kalamari came first and it was ok. Our drinks were finished so we ordered more.Finally she came with our entrees but still no beer we had ordered to go with our meals.So we reminded her again.My fish fry was warm and the fish was flaky.My moms fish fry,however, was cold and soggy and we had ordered the same thing.The cole slaw was good and tasted fresh and the hash browns I had ordered were good as well.My partners shrimp though was awful.It was greasy and mushy and tasted awful.The French fries accompanying it were undercooked and looked anemic, some of them had black coloring on them like the bad part of a potato that has rotted.Our server was still no where to be seen in order to ask about our drinks or inform her about the cold fish,soggy shrimp and undercooked fries.Finally we asked another waitress if she could find her.When we told her we were disappointed in the food,particularily the shrimp and undercooked potatoes she asked why we hadn't told her sooner, to which I really wanted to respond that not once did she check in with us to see how our meal was.She did handle it all professionally in the end and apologized, even took half off of our bill so that was nice.However, between one of us having basically no good entree at all and this being our first time there it really was a disappointment.Like I said the hashbrowns and coleslaw were good, the bartender and hostess service was good but we came there for a good fish fry and dinner service.Next time we are going to Tobys nearby instead.They consistently serve quality food along with good service.\",\n",

Staff is friendly and down home, but you'd better leave your big-city attitude at home.\\n\\nWe went for a Friday night fish fry. I live in Seattle these days and was not about to miss the opportunity while in town.\\n\\nStarted with a couple of Spotted Cows (on tap!) while the rest drank Miller Lite. (Told ya...) There were five adults plus a 12-year old.\\n\\nWalleye was excellent, the waitress was too. We made reservations and the table was ready well ahead of time.

(another caveat: there are maybe six restaurants in McFarland that don\\'t have drive-thrus)  \\n\\nI ordered the Walleye and eggs both times along with a bloody mary (gotta love a beer back, yay for Wisconsin). Now I am well aware of the number of bones that a whole Walleye contains and cannot in any way hold the Beach House responsible for that. I can say that the breading was perfectly crispy and well seasoned and that the fish was not at all over cooked, nice and moist. plus I think it cost $10 which was awesome (you can\\'t get fish for breakfast at these prices in Chicago) \\n\\nFor me the biggest highlight of breakfast here is what they do to the potatoes (their name for them is eluding me at the moment) by request they will top your breakfast potatoes with a heap of meat, veggies and cheese, enough to make it a hangover-soaking-up meal unto itself.\\n\\nTo sum it all up: if you find yourself looking for breakfast and a little \"hair o\\' the dog\" in McFarland Wisconsin because \"What happens at the Beach House, stays at the Beach House\" and we all love that about any restaurant.',\n",

       " \"I got a Groupon for here for my fiancee and mine's anniversary, and we finally were able to get there a month later.  The restaurant was super easy to find and I loved how it was right on the lake.  I spent a lot of time the last few summers in northern WI on a lake, so it was nice to be back on a lake again- brought back good memories!  We did not make a reservation, so it was an hour wait for a table when we arrived.  We hung out in the slightly crowded bar and had a few drinks while we were waiting.  The drinks were good and the bartenders were attentive, so no complaints there!  We were seated at a table that had a great view of the lake.  They had lots of specials going on that night (Friday night fish!), and we started with pepperjack cheese curds.  Delish!  They had a really nice bite at the end of them from the peppers.  I got the blue gill/lake perch combo and my fiancee got the Caribbean salmon.  I know blue gill is a thinner fish, and while my dish was good, there was not a lot of actual fish under the batter.  I got a salad with my fish with a tomato basil vinaigrette, which was surprisingly good and coleslaw which was pretty standard.  The salmon with the Caribbean dipping sauce was fantastic, but the veggies he got as a side was just some steamed broccoli and carrots- not very creative!  Our server was attentive all night, even though the restaurant was super busy all night.  By the time we left, I was very full and satisfied.\",\n",
       " 'Ate there last night with a group of friends.  The waitstaff was friendly, but that was pretty much the only good thing of the night.  I hate french onion soup that was so salty, it tasted like a salt lick.

The egg rolls were at least crispy and well-rolled, but they had absolutely no seasoning other than a tad too much salt.  The shrimp were overcooked, the barbecue pork was dry, and the hot dumplings were cold and under seasoned.\\n\\nThen came the entrees.  I ordered Imperial Chicken, thinking that being the restaurant's namesake, it had to be good.  I was wrong.  The breading was mushy, the chicken was dry, and the sauce was basically  sweet and sour sauce with added hoisan, and several dried peppers that were burnt so badly they added an unintentional, overdone smoky flavor.\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the Ma-po Tofu.  He loves spicy food, and this was just a little spicy, but the spice overpowered all the other flavors in the dish (besides the scallions).  The tofu was a good texture, but the unbalanced sauce flavors basically rendered it inedible.\\n\\nApart from the horrendous food was the tepid service.  I had to ask several times for a glass of water.  The waitress came by with the water pitcher and had just enough to fill my glass up halfway, so she returned to the kitchen for a refill and stopped by to fill my boyfriend's glass.  By this time, I drank my half glass of water - and she didn't even bother to top mine off.  I tried to ask for some, but she walked away.  \\n\\nPlus, I thought it was supposed to be an authentic Chinese food restaurant - what's with the Vivaldi and Mozart soundtrack?\\n\\nSkip this place all together and hit up the Asian grocery and gas station next door.

I wanted a decadent treat for myself and decided on the (market price) 45$ Lobster dinner entree which came with two choices of preparation. Ginger sauce or garlic butter  i ordered the garlic but the server said no the other was best.\\nMore importantly i asked her how large the lobster was and if it was sold by pound cause it was listed as Market Price. She said she would inquire before i ordered and returned to our table and said it was 2.5 pds or larger. So that made me excited and i did not hesitate in my ordering. I thought 45 dollars was a great price for a generous 2.5 pd lobster entree.\\nWhat arrived on my plate was a cut up overly sauced jigsawed puzzled lobster animation on a platter which was in no way a 2.5 pound creature to begin with. It was dismantled then pieced together to look like a lobster shape. The meat was still in shell. (and I mean IN SHELL).  There was hardly any meat to be had. The tail which should have been the meatiest portion was cut in one inch pieces with shell INTACT and had yielded maybe 2 morsel of meat total.  I was shocked as i struggled to manipulate any source of goodness from the pieces of crustacean.There was literally no lobster and what was there was swimming in overpowering sticky sauce. All in all an EXTREME disappointment. Not what I was expecting in the LEAST!!\\n\\nAs the storm gained intensity outdoors, my high hopes and any thoughts of returning to this eatery were un-intensified. I will NEVER return. I cannot tolerate being misled by a server\\n We ended up tipping and not making a fuss...just another lesson learned.

The restaurant itself and the bathrooms are clean and spacious. The ambiance is relaxed and pleasant, and noise levels are comfortably low.\\n\\nBut none of these things can save the mediocre-to-bad food. That is, if you get your food at all. On more than one occasion, they have forgotten to include entire entrees or side dishes when I've picked up take-out. I now double-check all of my orders before leaving. The egg rolls taste like they came out of a box in the freezer. They are greasy and heavy, with very little flavor until you douse them in sweet-and-sour sauce that's so sweet it might as well be syrup. The same problems plague the entirely unremarkable crab rangoon. I've had the hot and sour soup, and disliked the taste quite a bit. Not spicy enough, and far too sour. I usually order the ginger beef stir-fry. There's hardly any ginger flavor, and the sauce is thick and also fairly sweet. If they halved the amount of sugar in everything, it would be a good start. I've had more success with the sizzling black pepper beef, which has a punch of black pepper and a good balance of meat and vegetables. On a recent trip, a friend got the beef lo mein. It had a nice quantity of beef, but an anemic quantity of vegetables. It was also very greasy and watery, and tasted extremely bland. The only reason I go here as often as I do is that my grandmother (the poster child for stereotypical Wisconsin taste buds, bless her heart) loves the three delicacies sizzling rice.\\n\\nI did discover one saving grace: if you dump sriracha on the food, it blends very well with the food and elevates all of the flavors. Too bad they don't have any of it at the restaurant, it could save many a dish. Bottom line: there's much better, more authentic, more balanced, and less heavy Chinese food available in Madison at comparable prices.

       " \"At its best the Bristled Boar is a great place to go with friends for an after-work drink or three, and maybe a game of pool or darts or just watch the game.  At its worst it is the epitome of a townie joint.  I've seen both over the last five years.  When I first visited the Boar it was a dive.  My college roommate had a job tending bar and we would from time to time take up his offer of free drinks in return for keeping him company.  The barstools were often filled with the usual regulars, drinking under a thick pall of smoke.  There is a certain charm to dive bars and I'm sure for some the old Boar had it, but not for me.  \\n\\nFortunately the owner completed renovated the entire bar, and this happened right about the time I moved out to MIddleton.  In place of the dingy walls was stylish wood paneling and tile floors instead of linoleum.  The ceilings were raised and the ventilation was improved, and while it can certainly still get smoky my eyes don't burn anymore.  There is a sand volleyball court out back and bar leagues during the summer.  The jukebox is relatively standard, but there are a few gems tucked in amidst the usual country & hard rock options.  The regular crowd is still around, but a good deal more young people can be found at the Boar these days.  Some nights are vibrant and fun, some not so much.  I can't say that I've tried much of the food.  I know from my old roommate that there is a small grill in back, which was added during the renovation.  The Emil's pizzas are good as always.  All in all the new Boar is a complete improvement over the old one.\\n\\nThere are still a few things that keep the Boar from being my favorite in Middleton, namely the tap selection.  I am a beer snob and proud of it, so when the only local tap option is Spotted Cow I call foul.  I can't think of another Middleton bar that doesn't have at least one Capital tap, or at least Esser's Best.  What really seals it for me is sometimes the Spotted lines aren't even clean and the beer comes out flat and a bit funky.  Another complaint that I frequently have is some of the bartenders know next to nothing about proper drink mixing.  It is usually the same bartenders that act put upon to even mix a drink as opposed to just grabbing a bottle.  Some of the older bartenders are very good, but you almost have to know the schedule to avoid the others.\",\n",

It was pretty tame when I was there, but after looking at a few of the pictures, I can tell that this place gets pretty wild. Awesome. I had a nice conversation with some locals and enjoyed a few local brews that were a perfect end to a long day. \\n\\nSo next time you're in the neighborhood, come check this place out and give a nod to the stuffed boar head on the wall, it's seen a lot more action than pretty much everyone.\",\n",

It's not so bad, but it's just not that good.\\n\\nI think everything is frozen at this place. Everything. We had pizza there the other night and I could taste the freezer burn. We still had a blast, but it would be nice if the food wasn't so obviously frozen. Everything is ordered from the bar, which is fine but a little weird.\\n\\nThere isn't too much to say about this place other than what I've just said. I'll go back because my friends at work like it, but it wouldn't be my top choice.

The nice thing was that we were close enough to the starting line that it wasn't a huge issue for our first group of runners to leave at 5am and get there on time; however, being somewhat closer to where the race started might have been nicer and we're looking into that for 2013, because it was a bit of a haul for the second van (my van).\\n\\nOn the other hand, we were far enough away that this hotel did not fill up immediately and it had no problem blocking off some rooms for us and we were right off the highway, very close to restaurants for an easy group dinner and there is a shopping center right next door. I took full advantage of stocking up on anything I might have missed by going to the local Erehwon and running shop. That was incredibly convenient. They also have a really good continental breakfast.\\n\\nAs far as the hotel room: the beds were incredibly comfortable but the shower drain was backed up. I ended up in a couple inches of dirty water, which is never fun. However, I had some of the best sleep of my life.

Go to Gino\\'s a mile away if you\\'re craving meatballs.  The turkey club is stacked high and tastes exactly as you would expect.

The fish fry is a lot of good food for a good price.

We tried the vegetable beef soup - hearty, loaded with veggies, and the meat was tender and of good quality.  \\n\\nFor our entrees, we went a bit conservative - grilled chicken salads - but they were huge and tasty.  Fresh, fresh, fresh veggies - the tomatoes were wonderful as were the onions (red, and soooo sweet).  The salad was definitely an unexpected surprise - I\\'d get it again in a heartbeat!  \\n\\nOur dining companion ordered some chicken strips which he requested be tossed in their hot wings sauce.

No honey offered with them though.\\n\\nThe ugh: With the all of the acclaim their burgers get, you would think that they were doing something special here. They aren't. The burgers are frozen patties and look like they're right from Sysco. The reason that people are probably saying they're so good is because the patties aren't cooked within an inch of a briquette. Normally I would say that's a good thing, but when you're making me a burger from an unknown origin handled by who knows how many people....needless to say, medium rare frozen beef patty is doesn't = amazing burger in my book. \\n\\nI can't say that I would visit again. There are far too many amazing hamburgers on the west side made with real beef from local butchers to waste my time with this place.\\n\\nUPDATE: I've spoken with a couple of people that are thinking it may be a fluke that I ended up with frozen patties the time I was there.

All new equipment and works great. \\n\\nI have been using this place since I discovered it about a year ago. The remodeling took place in November and December 2012. Previously this was just car wash station with about 8 self serve stalls and 2 or three automatic. The remodeling removed some of the self service stalls (there are approx. 4 now) and used this space for a new Laundramat and a dog wash station, which i hear is one of the only ones in the Madison area. \\n\\nI have been there mostly on Sundays and they have an attendant who is an older gentlemen and is very friendly and fun to shoot the breeze with if you use the self service stations. Personally, I believe you cant get a better car wash than using the self service stations if you have the time and strength (your arms do get a little sore after!). For 5 dollars I believe, you get 12 minutes which is plenty of time to do a thorough wash, rinse, wax and time to use scrubber on front end/rims as needed. The soap is not watered down like other places. They also take credit card at the self service station, so no need to fill a sock full of quarters. The only other self service I know of in the Madison area is off Rimrock road, which is cheaper, but for less time, in a rough area, in terrible shape,  and the soap is MUCH more watered down. \\n\\nI have also used the laundramat there recently and received exceptional serivce. They have a special going on in March that all dryers are free! All new machines, therefore clothes come out smelling and looking great. In addition, this is a full service laundramat, therefore there is a regular attendant on duty who will do the washing, drying and foling for you. I believe the charge was 49 cents for every lb. They also have a promotion going on right now for the first 10lbs are free. It is a very convenient service if you have a lot of errands to run and dont want to waste an afternoon at the laundramat. I had quite a bit of laundry one day, and the attendant gave me a very good deal in addition to the 10 lbs free. Make sure to tip the attendant if you use this service, she did an excellent job and saves you a ton of time!\\n\\nI have not used the dog wash, as I do not have a dog, but I imagine it could be something fun to do.\\n\\nThe only negative I have about this place is that is hard to get in and out of, as you have to pull in behind the building and turn the corner of the building at a blind spot.

Although this location carries the Aveda name, it appears to be buckling under its weight. There are many issues at this salon, and only a few will be mentioned here.\\n\\nTangles Salon has had a somewhat tortured existence here in the Madison area, what with experiencing not-so-smooth management changes, relocating attempts, massive employee walkouts, and even a fire in the past 2 years alone. One begins to wonder how they have stayed afloat as long as they have.\\n\\nAfter a devastating fire destroyed Tangles, it was clear that many once loyal customers had been caught in the middle of the chaos. Some arrived at the salon for their appointments, only to find the building in charred ruins, and most never got a courtesy call from the owners. Furthermore, the fire raises red flags related to safety, Although not mentioned in the police report, many ex-clients have speculated that the entire situation was suspicious.\\n\\nA receptionist named Deeon, was at the front desk when I last entered Tangles. He welcomed me to the salon, but his demeanor was cold and businesslike. He seemed very out of place in the salon, and didn't seem to really enjoy being there as he led me to the chair. I waited for 10 minutes for my stylist to come over from the very noisy break room I was unfortunate enough to have been next to. As I was waiting, I noticed an accumulation of hair and dust around the edges of the station. There were also many dead insects in the overhead fluorescent lighting, indicating lack of cleanliness throughout the salon.\\n\\nOn the plus side, Tangles does have some talented stylists. But without the proper management and support, their work remains spotty and inconsistent at best.\\n\\nI wanted to like this salon, but found it difficult to look past the issues. It is important to note that it is difficult for any business to survive changing locations multiple times. However, when combined with the suspicious fire, the disgruntled clients, and the unstable behind the scenes management, it is safe to say that Tangles needs a deep conditioning treatment if they want to remain relevant in this city.\",\n",

To me that's a good thing, even though I'm not big on rhubarb.

Instead of one big one, you get two smaller ones. Since you get two and your choice of chicken or beef, I asked for one of each. \\n\\nThey brought my platter, and after I took a bite of beans I noticed our waitress hovering over me with another platter. She explained that \"this one\" had one of each, and that she was going to take the one they gave me and \"just throw it away.\" \\n\\nA waste, because it wasn\\'t really that big of a deal if they\\'d brought me two of the same; there was no price difference and I wasn\\'t dead set on having one of each. \\n\\nAs it turns out, I think they had originally given me what I asked for and took it away, because my replacement plate was two chicken chimis*. Food trashed for no reason, and potentially the correct order (or they plated it incorrectly, twice). \\n\\n*Their idea of chimichangas are really just bigger-than-average flautas; they were open-ended and have no filling aside from the meat.

       " 'Quick Review: If it weren\\'t for the stellar fish fry and the awesome beer selection, this place would be a solid 2.5-star establishment.  Alas, the fish is unreal and the beer selection rivals many (if not most) of Madison\\'s finest.\\n\\nDetailed Review:\\nThe Fish Fry Fanatics stumbled into Dexter\\'s Pub this past Friday and decided to give their fish fry a shot.  The menu selection is vast - we counted at least 6 or 7 solid fish fry options, from shrimp to Lake Perch to Walleye.  \\n\\nWe put our name in for a table, and were told it would be a 35-40 minute wait, so we ordered some of our customary Old Fashioneds.  We were pleasantly surprised to find that the bartenders muddle their Old Fashioneds, but were disappointed by the inclusion of a huge chunk of orange.  I\\'m sorry to say, but a Whiskey Old Fashioned Sour should *not* include half-of-an-orange as garnish.  \\n\\nRegardless, the Old Fashioned was solid - very good, actually.  So much so that when we ordered a second round and requested they drop the orange, it wasn\\'t a problem.  Dexter\\'s recovered nicely, and as luck would have it, our table became available soon after we grabbed round 2 of drinks. \\n\\nWe immediately ordered cheese curds, salad, and soup.  I went with the vegetable garden soup; others at the table went with chili and salad.  The soup and salads arrived within seconds; the soup was good - not great, but good - and it could\\'ve been a little warmer.  I\\'m told the chili was good as well - not life altering, but good.\\n\\nThe waiter came back to take our dinner order: two orders of beer battered cod, an order of lake perch, and an order of shrimp.  He said he\\'d be back in 10 minutes with our fish.  \\n\\nNearly an hour later, we flagged down a waitress for: refills on our drinks, and to inquire about our curds and fish.  She apologized profusely... curds came out a few minutes later - apparently they forgot about us.  The only benefit to being forgotten was that we had plenty of time to read the beer menu, which features a nice selection of craft beers from microbreweries - Dexter\\'s doesn\\'t strike me as a place that would feature such a wide selection of unique beers, but I guess it goes to prove that you can never judge a book by its cover.  \\n\\nCurds were excellent - not your typical \"from the bag\" curds, which was a nice surprise.  They were breaded and featured a mild white cheese; they were cooked perfectly.\\n\\nFish arrived within minutes, and it was well worth the wait.  The cod was phenomenal.  Three huge pieces with a mound of fries - now that\\'s what we\\'re talkin\\' about.  The batter was light, crisp, and flavorful.  The fish was thick, meaty, and perfectly flavored.  I loved every single bite of it.\\n\\nI also sampled the Lake Perch and shrimp - both of which were excellent as well.  Huge props to Dexter\\'s for their fish fry - it\\'s definitely a top-10 offering.\\n\\nIn the end, they also made things good as the waiter comp\\'ed us our drinks and curds, so we got out of there for under $40.  We tipped well and called it a night.  I\\'d definitely go back to Dexter\\'s - sure, they dropped the ball, but they did an honorable thing and made everything right by us.  Thanks, Dexter\\'s!!\\n\\nDexter\\'s = WIN\\n\\nFood = 4.5 stars (excellent fish; curds and fries were stellar)\\nService = 2 stars (they forgot about us, but made up for it)\\nValue = 2 stars (would\\'ve been over $85 for the 4 of us)\\nMisc = 3 stars (the place isn\\'t much to look at, but has an excellent beer selection...)\\n\\nOh - also, parking is hard to come by, so be prepared to park on the street and/or walk a bit to get there.',\n",

I can't rave enough about how delicious the pint of Gnarleywine was.\\n\\nThe food is solid, as many people have already Yelped. \\nMy lake perch was delicious - in my opinion, better than Avenue Bar's. I was full when I finished the 1/4 of their huge serving portion. \\n\\nGood mix of crowd. Kids, 20-somethings, old and all. I shall be back there to sample more beer and heckle at Olympic games on a TV screen.\",\n",
       " \"I wanted fish fry last night, but we didn't feel like driving, so we figured we'd give Dexter's a try. (It's 3 blocks from our house.) \\n\\nMy first impression was that this place doesn't belong in Madison - it belongs somewhere much farther north. There was an awesome mix of people there, which is always a good sign for me. They had all sorts of games playing on the multiple tvs (not just basketball, hooray!) and my boyfriend was delighted to note that they have shuffleboard.\\n\\nWe were seated immediately (pretty good for a Friday night) and placed our drink orders. My boyfriend got a Great Lakes Irish Red something or other, and I ordered a Pyramid Winter Ale, which wasn't all that great. I personally wish that they had some more local stuff on the beer menu, but aside from that, I can't really complain about the selection.\\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered beer battered cod with carrot soup, and my boyfriend ordered a burger with chili garlic fries. Our food was AMAZING. This is hands down the best fish fry I've had outside of da nortwoods, definitely the best I've had in Madison so far. The soup was interesting but delicious - kind of spicy with a hint of cilantro. I didn't try my boyfriend's burger, but the chili garlic fries were awesome. I'm someone who believes that there is no such thing as too much garlic, though, so they might be a bit much for less of a garlic lover.\\n\\nI am so stoked to have found a great fish fry place so close to our house. We will definitely be going back soon.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve been frequenting Dexter\\'s quite often over the past few months (to the tune of around twice per week) and am happy to report that every visit has been absolutely STELLAR.\\n\\nThere\\'s the obviously excellent beer selection - it\\'s constantly rotating, and it always tastes fresh and wonderful.  The staff really know their beer - if you ever have a question, don\\'t hesitate to ask because they will offer a sample, suggestions, and plenty of information.\\n\\nThe food has been incredible with every visit.  Sure bets: the hummus platter (wow, that IPA hummus is unreal), the waffle fries, any of the burgers, most of the specials, and of course, the fish fry.\\n\\nI\\'ve had several burgers (The Abbey (with tomato garlic sauce), the Defibrillator (onions, ham, bacon, egg, cheese), and the Patty Melt) - each was delicious, and they cook them exactly to order.\\n\\nI\\'ve had the Santa Fe Chicken salad - wow, those roasted veggies are great.  The soups have also been excellent - I recently had the spicy vegetable and the chili; the chili features a spice that slowly crescendos - by the end of the cup, you\\'re feeling a little of that capsaicin love.\\n\\nI\\'ve had several specials, including a turkey melt and a loaded ham and cheese.\\n\\nAnd of course, I\\'ve had the fish fry several more times and am PLEASED to report that it remains excellent.  The hearty, perfectly applied batter and the flaky fresh cod is among Madison\\'s best.  I will be updating my fish fry review with new pictures and details in the near future.\\n\\nService has markedly improved - the staff is fast, friendly, and as mentioned, super helpful.  I really enjoy their company - it\\'s great to drop by and sit at the bar or to grab a table and chill for a while.\\n\\nUPDATE: Dexters = MAJOR WIN\\n\\nFood = 4.75 stars.

       " \"This has easily become my go-to Friday fish fry.  I like it so much, I've been hesitant to even write this review.  Nonetheless, Dexter's does it right.\\n\\nFresh, Bering sea cod enveloped in a crispy, salty batter keeps me dreaming of Fridays.  The clam chowder is phenomenal and so are the rest of their soups...obviously lovingly tended to and cooked from homemade stocks.  I could further pontificate, but no need...the execution in the kitchen is stellar.  \\n\\nNow, the beer list is exquisite in my opinion.  I love Madison, but many bars get so caught up on local-centric taps lists.  Consequently, more often than not, you walk in to see the taps jammed with Ale Ayslum, Lake Louie and Capital.  Not bad...but I'll be damned to say I could choke down another Hopalicious.  Dexters, on the other hand, opens their taps up to pretty much anything.  From Toppling Goliath (which I love, but you can't really get outside of Iowa and Wisco) to Belgian Flander's Reds, they kill it with their beer selection.  Also, I really respect that they let you know on the beer list what's on deck...this has kept me coming back many-a-times.  \\n\\nSo why not the 5-stars?  Well, we've run into some seriously long waits, both for a table and then for the fish.  If they could streamline a little more in the kitchen, I'd gladly give it that extra star.  In the mean time, we NEVER come here on Fridays after 6pm....forget it.  If you don't mind dining with the Greyhairs....you'll do just fine.\",\n",
       " \"After reading several rave reviews for the fish fry we decided to try this place.  We arrived at 5:30 on a Friday in Lent and knew we were already in trouble when parking was hard to find.  The dining room was packed and we were told there would be an hour wait.  Since we had driven across town, we decided to wait it out in the bar.  There is plenty of room to wait and have a beer from the huge selection they have.  In 30 minutes we were called for our table.  Two of us ordered the lake perch and one ordered the deep fried cod.  There is also baked cod, walleye, blue gill and shrimp to choose from.  The fish comes with your choice of  - baked potato, waffle fries, pub fries, homemade potato chips, and some other things like cottage cheese etc.  We had waffle fries, potato chips and the pub fries, which are beer pattered.  You also get a small container of cole slaw and a white grocery store roll.  There was a short wait for our fish, but the dining room was still packed.  When it arrived, it was hot, tasty and a generous serving.  We were all very satisfied with our dinner.  I thought the homemade potato chips were excellent, they came out warm and crispy.  The only thing I did not care for was the tartar sauce, can't place what it was, but had a funny taste to it to me.  Everyone that waited on us was friendly and efficient without being intrusive.  Wish this place was closer to my side of town, but we will definitely try it again.  Get there early or expect to wait!\",\n",

The chunks of clam were huge and tender, not chewy.  The soup wasn't too thick that it overshadowed the clams, onions and potatoes.  We both ordered the deep fried cod.  One of the best we've had.

There is a wide variety of vegetarian options which is nice.  I also have to mention that I won't be eating here again soon as they have very recently taken my 2 favorite items off the menu; the tuna steak sandwich, and the cajun chicken sandwich.  The cumin chipotle mayonnaise on the tuna sandwich was one of the only reasons I would even still go to Monty's.\\n\\nThe service is always terrible.  you can count on a long wait for your waiter to take your order, for them to bring your drinks, and your food, and the longest wait of all is always for the check.  I have contemplated a dine and dash many times.  I counted the minutes one time, and it was 45 minutes from the time I finished eating to when the check came.  It wasn't because the waitress didn't see me from behind the counter either, she was talking to another server.  Once, I was eating with a friend, and we were waiting for 15 minutes to even have our waiter come to the table, so we just left.   Believe me, the service being slow is never because there isn't enough servers or too many diners.   \\n\\nThe food is decent, but it's not great by any means. It is still pretty okay, although I've had some bad meals.  The meatless meatloaf is only saved by the cashew gravy, and the salmon cakes are awful.  The tuna sandwich was really good, but the size and bun has changed over the years, and recently been replaced by 3 kinds of pastrami sandwiches.

Besides that, I\\'ve never noticed it being *especially* slow... just kind of slow, which doesn\\'t really bother me.\\n\\nLet me take a moment here to recommend the Meatloaf Sandwich: Get it served cold.  Just trust me here.  Do not get it hot.  I\\'ve had it served both ways: Cold, it is a sandwich so delicious that fireworks go off in your head; Warm, it is an open-faced abomination with gravy and mashed potatoes poured all over it.\\n\\nTheir cheeseburger was surprisingly good (I\\'d even go so far to say that it\\'s one of the best burgers I\\'ve had in Madison).  They had a special entree one evening, \"Cheeseburger Mac & Cheese,\" which was out of this world.  It really tasted like a cheeseburger over noodles!  They serve a great chef salad, have awesome spicy waffle fries, and I would die 100 times over for the buttermilk biscuits they serve with breakfast.  Their expansive dessert case is as tasty as it is impressive looking.\\n\\nI was beyond sold on this place one time when I ordered a piece of german chocolate cake for dessert.  It wasn\\'t a piece so much as it was a towering slab.  It was so tall, in fact, that it wasn\\'t until I\\'d eaten enough of it that I noticed that the waiter (who was wearing a mohawk and kilt) had written, \"Das ist Deutsch\" in chocolate on the plate.  \\n\\nI\\'ve had questionable service twice: Once was when I reserved a pie for a dinner I was going to and they did not have it when I got there, but tried to placate me by selling me a larger, more expensive pie.  That was after I approached the counter and saw several staff members stare at me for 20 minutes before I was finally helped.  The other time was when I was there for coffee and dessert with friends, and we paid with a card.  The waiter told us, upon picking up the card, \"You know, if you can, you should really give me my tip in cash.  We don\\'t see it on our paychecks for another 2 weeks otherwise.\"  Um...thanks for the advice on how we should tip you.

About half of the menu is vegetarian-friendly, with a couple of vegan items as well.  The veggie meatloaf was the best of the food we ate (not including the pie), but the tempeh in the veggie BLT was nicely prepared too.  We didn't try breakfast items, but tofu scrambler was available and looked great.  The food was delicious, the desserts were enormous and divine, and we thought the service was fast and friendly.  We were there on a Sunday evening and a Monday lunch, and neither time did we wait for a table.

There are many delicious and satisfying options. If you don't restrict your diet in any way, there are many great meaty and chalorically rich options for you too. Watching carbs? Get a sandwich in a wrap. Looking for a healthy lean meat option?

This place does it well and at a pretty decent price. \\n\\nThough, I don't personally think Monty's is overrated, I feel that the point needs to be made. Whatever you order will be fresh and pretty tasty. However, say you order The Meatloaf of the Gods, it may not be what you expect if you are the type of person that is looking for traditional 'the-way-mom-made-it' meatloaf slathered with ketchup. If you are looking for an extensive breakfast menu consisting of traditional American breakfast combos (i.e. - a dish that contains ALL of the following: pancakes, eggs, hash browns, 3 kinds of meat and toast), Denny's or Perkin's may be a better option for you. \\n\\nThey put their own spin on the more traditional dishes and have created an awesome list of in-house specialties. Whether you eat meat or not you MUST try The Meatless Meatloaf of the Gods. It's amazing. Like your beef? Definitely try the Blueplate Burger! Don't like beef so much but still want a burger? Try the Blueplate Burger with a locally made walnut burger. \\n\\nNo matter who you are, Monty's is worth a try.\",\n",

They also have ridiculously delicious chocolate shakes, so don't be afraid to splurge while you're there.  \\n\\nOne of the other great things about Monty's is the atmosphere; the area around it is filled with little mom and pop shops, the Barrymore theater, and relics of an older time.  Take a stroll around if it's a nice day and your bound to find something you like.  If not, I'm sure you probably enjoyed the food as all the dishes I've ever had were great and the portions were generous.\\n\\nThere are a few drawbacks though that held me back from giving a 5 star review.  First, there is usually a very long wait.  The place is popular, but I don't feel that the food and eastside location (I live far westside) always justifies the overall experience.  Secondly, the service is hit or miss.  I've had some waitresses who were prompt and polite, making me feel right at home, and others who were sarcastically rude to the point where people in my party almost had to say something.  Furthermore, the kitchen doesn't always look clean, as trays of biscuits have been left sitting out and flies have been a buzzing.\\n\\nSetting all those things aside though (which I know may be hard for some), the blue plate is a Madison delight that should not be missed.

Breakfast potatoes were solid and didn't provoke the usual request for Cholula/Tabasco. I appreciated the fact that fresh fruit is offered as a side with most breakfasts. Definitely hit the spot.

I wanted the best paint, with the primer, all the bells and whistles.  I was covering purple.  I needed it.  The salesperson said I could pick from any four.  Yet, he could not tell me why one was rated higher or called premium over the other.  It was weird.  Like here are your options but I can not tell you what their difference really is.  And some were the same brand.\\n\\n2. When painting the ceiling of said room, we open up a can of paint and notice it has clumps in it.  This paint was about six months old.  Nothing happened to it.  So we go back to Menard's.  We have shopped at several area Menard's, because we are about convenience.  The lady at the counter was SO rude.  We did not have our receipt and could not find it in their system.  We pay for most things in cash and apparently this is NOT a good idea at Menard's.  It had a Menard's sticker which this location does not use (but other locations still use).  \\n\\nEVERY time we tried to talk to someone she kept speaking over us and saying this can not be from here.  We then had to repeat AGAIN, that we do not just shop at this location.  We shop outside the city sometimes.  We pick things up on our way home.  \\n\\nAnother rep interceded and offered to return it for us.  She was SO nice.  I wish I remembered all of their names.  But she needed a person from paint to approve it.\\n\\nBefore looking at the paint, a rep spoke to this RUDE customer service rep and said he could not take the paint back.  It must be our fault and that is that.  Then they said they could not take and dispose of it.  Nice huh?  No one asked us anything.  The paint was BRAND new!  \\n\\n3. The same day we went to return the paint, we wanted to look at screen doors.  There was no one in the section and you would have thought we were pulling teeth when we did find someone.  He was SO short with us and kept walking away while we still had questions.  It was ridiculous.  \\n\\nSo the prices keep us going back but the rest?  Awful/Hellish.\",\n",
       " 'I\\'ve revisited this Menards countless times over the past few months. Lately, I\\'ve only been coming here when I absolutely must; I much prefer going to my local hardware store - their selection for anything that\\'s not a big-ticket item is better, as is the service and overall experience. \\n\\n- There are signs posted in several places that claim, \"No waiting for savings! If there are more than 2 customers waiting to check-out, we\\'ll open additional check-out lanes!\" -- I have yet to see this happen. A most recent visit left us waiting in line for nearly 10 minutes before checking out.\\n\\n- The indoor/outdoor lumberyard is a source of frustration. I would venture a guess that one of the more commonly sought items from a hardware store like Menards is the basic 2x4 (or similar dimensional piece of lumber). Any idea where they\\'re located? We wandered the indoor lumberyard for a good 5 minutes before realizing that the 2x4s are located in the faaaaaaaaaar back corner from the main entrance. You have to walk by scores of 1-by-whatevers, fence posts, fence slats, decorative posts, synthetic decking, lattice, and other rarely used items before you get to the 2-by-whatevers. Do you need pressure treated wood? That\\'s outside, somewhere. Do you need cedar? That\\'s on the opposite end of the indoor yard. Do you need plywood? It\\'s at the front of the lumberyard. Do you need insulation? It\\'s in the middle of the lumberyard... catch the problem? There\\'s zero organization/logic...\\n\\n- The outdoor lumberyard. I hate (as do my contractor friends) checking in and out with the lumberyard guard. Put it all inside like every other store does and call it good.\\n\\n- Limited supply of plumbing items. I recently needed a Sharkbite connector for a plumbing project I was doing with PEX. Menards didn\\'t have the fittings, but my tiny little local Ace Hardware did. A few days ago, I needed a John Guest fitting, which Menards didn\\'t have, but my local Ace Hardware did. \\n\\n+ Holiday sales are usually a good deal, especially for large ticket items like ceiling fans and whatnot.',\n",

No longer do you have to venture downtown to get said sandwich. And the one I had wasn't a ticking grease bomb!\\n\\nDo yourself a favor when you go and try the red lentil soup. The flavor is excellent and there's plenty of cumin to spare. Delicious! My gyro and bowl of soup plus coffee was under $10, so it's a great choice when you're low on cash and need a filling lunch.\\n\\n(Oh, and it's right next to El Pescador, across from the Madison East Shopping Center.

Either way, that Parthenon in Madison is crap, people rave about it, what a joke, they have no clue what good gyros is, take a road trip and go eat at Hubs in Chicago, then you will know finally what great gyros is. In the meantime, if you are stuck in Madison, this is by far the best you will find, don\\'t waste your money and calories elsewhere.\\n\\nFalafel is good, has it\\'s own unique recipe, works for me.\\n\\nTan Tan Chicken is very good too, highly spiced, which I like, although not spicy as far as heat is concerned. Comes with an awesome garlic dip, which I\\'ve only found in Los Angeles at Zankou Chicken, which by the way is the most incredible middle-eastern chicken ever. They even made a \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" episode about it in 2011. If you get out to LA ever, you must go to Zankou and get the Chicken Tarna with the garlic dip, the hummus is also the best ever. Almost enough to make me want to move back to LA. In fact...\\n\\nAnyway, People\\'s Bakery is truly a gem in Madison, amongst all the questionable eateries, which some say are great, others say bad, this one is clearly a huge winner. And it is a real Mom & Pop, literally they made all the food for me, super friendly, down to Earth, real people who deserve to have your business. Go there now!\\n\\nP.S.

The \"Rapid Dozen\" is a good value, providing a diverse sampling of donut types to take to work, provided they make it that far.\\n\\nStill, my main inspiration behind the countless visits through the years is the Lebanese cuisine, and specifically the falafel.

       " 'I\\'ve been to the Harmony several times before, but last night was the first time I\\'ve been there for live music, and also the first time I tried their famed Walnut Burger.\\n\\nFirst, you should know that the Harmony is indeed a bar. If you go expecting an upscale \"gastro-pub\" experience of chic bar food, then you will be disappointed. There are no waiters, and you seat yourself. You order food and drinks at the bar, and  a food runner brings out your order when it\\'s ready. Its got a dive bar atmosphere, and the interior is pretty run down. \\n\\nAfter fighting for a table due to the crowd that was rapidly accumulating in anticipation of that evening\\'s band, my friends and I perused the menu. It contains primarily stereotypical bar food (burgers, fries, onion rings, etc), but there are a few exceptions. There are several vegetarian options, including veggie nachos, so if you\\'re a non meat eater, you would probably find lots of things to order at The Harmony. Most notably, The Harmony offers a walnut burger. I\\'m told they\\'re famous for it, so I ordered the walnut burger with blue cheese and a side of homemade potato chips with \"Bleu Cheese Dip\". (What can I say, I really, really love Blue Cheese!) It took awhile for the food to come out, so we drank beer while we waited. Our table of about 10 people ordered 3 pitchers to share. I am not sure what all of them were, but in honor of the WI bar experience, I stuck to PBR. It was as good as PBR can be.\\n\\nOnto the food: The blue cheese walnut burger came topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce in addition to blue cheese crumbles, rather than plain blue cheese crumbles like I had been anticipating. It also came with onion, lettuce, tomato, and mayo. The lettuce and tomato were exceptionally fresh and ripe looking. I was really impressed, especially by the tomato (it was actually red!). I bit into it and was immediately transported to blue cheese heaven. It was fantastic. I will qualify this praise with the statement that the reason I loved this burger so much was largely a result of the copious blue cheese flavor. I am not sure the walnut burger itself was why it tasted so great. The chips were also awesome. They arrived piping hot. Some were crunchy and others were chewier. It was clear that they were made to order. The Bleu Cheese Dip they came with was similar to what came on my burger, and as a result, was amazing. \\n\\nWe ate as the band played and just reveled in how fun the whole experience was. By the way, the band was great! It was a Rockabilly group called The Fast Clydes. If you like that style of music, I couldn\\'t recommend them more. They had a ton of energy and knew how to work the crowd. I had a blast. \\n\\nAll this said, there are a few things that I think The Harmony could improve upon. First off, the tables in the main dining area are plastic. They\\'re the exact same tables that you played beer pong on in college. I feel like The Harmony excels in spite of its dive bar atmosphere, and not necessarily because of it. Therefore, if they invested just a little bit of money to spruce up the interior, I think they would see a return. The Atwood area is still rocking that hippie vibe, for sure, but more and more, I am noticing newer and more upscale establishments. To me, that says that there\\'s probably a market for it and the times, they are a changin\\'. Also, I don\\'t mind ordering food and drinks at the bar. However, I think The Harmony would benefit from offering table service, at least during shows on Friday and Saturday night. I have only ever been to The Harmony with a group, and it sucks to have to walk away from the conversation to get another beer, a process which can take 10 or 15 minutes if it\\'s crowded. All-in-all, these drawbacks are minor, and I\\'ll be back at The Harmony many times this summer!',\n",

I asked the person taking my order about his recommendations for sides. He said-definitely the fries and the baked beans. The baked beans were delicious! Also sweet with a little kick at the end and then with a little sweetness to it. I just want to take the time right now to say that I hate beans-the consistency of it and the way that they\\'re often overloaded with lard/butter.

Having two boys changing from BMX style to Mountain bikes, I had no idea what to look for size wise. Gary showed both boys the different bikes and took the time to explain the differences. When each of them picked out the style of bike that they liked the most, Gary measured each of them and suggested the correct size knowing that they will need room to grow.

It was impressive to see that both of the boys fealt comfortable and were totally ingaged with Gary and Mike like they had known them for years. It was obvious that both the men have kids and could relate specifically on a personal level before professional.

Ouch.\\n\\n- Limited selection of \"staple-goods.\"  Sure, I can get fresh Alaskan King Crab or a locally-made vegan cookie from the bakery at a moment\\'s notice, but I dare you to find a box of Blueberry Special K on a Sunday night... I think they stock 4 or 5 of those, and when they\\'re gone, they\\'re gone (they\\'re also about $1 higher than Woodman\\'s).\\n\\n- It\\'s inconvenient to get in and out of.  University Avenue S-U-C-K-S sucks.  And, if you wish to head west from Metcalfe\\'s, you have to turn onto Midvale, make a U-turn, and then sit at the Midvale/University light and wait... The parking lot is also a cluster-F.\\n\\n- The checkers can be a bit snooty.  That, or I get the same girl every time... it really does seem as though I\\'m bothering the heck out of her by giving her a handful of items to scan, waiting on a total, and then giving her money.  I usually encounter a \"why-are-you-bothering-me-with-this\" sigh or a roll of the eyes at some point during checkout.  \\n\\n- The clientele can be a bit snobby (especially the ones that hop out of their leased BMWs).  Yeah, so you think you\\'re cool in your BMW, but we both know that you\\'re living in a rundown apartment, using one credit card to pay the other, and you\\'re maybe 2-weeks from having the Bimmer repo\\'d.

Cool.\\n\\nI spend a lot of time in Hilldale teaching ballet to tiny humans, so I decided to do my weekly shopping at Metcalfe's for the convenience. \\n\\nMany things to note here, so I'll point out the items that stood out like an MBA player in Japan.\\n\\n1) The carts glide smoothly.  Yes, I know this sounds dumb, but for someone who dances all the time and am 99% of my life physically tired, I HATE.  I repeat, HATE when I have to scoot a cart around that won't turn.  This was like gliding on velvet and I wanted to faint.  It's the little things in life people.\\n\\n2) Artisan bread.  Don't go searching for the cheap bread.  Pick up a nice loaf of crusty, fire baked carb-luvin heaven and giggle as you walk away.  \\n\\n3) Local and organic.  Speaks for itself.\\n\\n4) Classical music.  For once in my entire life I was not stressed out shopping.  Waaaaaah?  My blood pressure was normal.  I did not want to punch anyone.  It was enjoyable.\\n\\n5) Parcel pick up service.  Drive your car around and they'll load ya up. 1st class style.\\n\\n6) Dollar bills dollar bills.  Coupon, save, and pinch your pennies, because the 1% style of shopping will cost you a few more bucks than your average shopping experience.\\n\\nLet me tell you though, I'll be going back.

A lot for one lemon, right?  When I was at check out, they range them up as $1.99/lemon.  Over 100% more and I had to wait 10 minutes for the manager to credit back my $2.00.  I just wonder how often this happens.  Plus, I think their organic produce is more expensive than whole foods.  If you have time, shop at Metcalf's for supplies but buy your produce at whole foods or the market.  And be sure to check the prices at the register!!\",\n",

I had a very specific look I wanted, and she was able to take the cute Pinterest photos I provided as inspiration and create truly spectacular arrangements using the elements I loved.  She worked hard to figure out which local flowers would be available at the time, and as a result we only had to have a few things that were sourced regionally instead of locally - very cool!! \\n\\nThe flowers were all beautifully packaged and well labeled, as well, which made it easy for the folks setting up the morning of. Sally also had some great ideas that contributed to our day, as I probably wouldn't have gone hunting for vintage lace for my bouquet handle without prompting.  It made a lovely addition.

Club Pallazzo certainly charges enough for cover to afford a new couch.

It's definitly the atmosphere that brings all the boot-stomping night owls out en masse. The frescoes on the walls and ceiling sport scantily clad vampiresses looking for a bite, and the velvet curtains that hang from the ceiling to the floor, along with the throne chairs give the club it's regal aire.\\n\\nThe Music: It's true, they have different DJ's switch off sets.

For once, I was ready to go bright and early so that we could make the six-hour drive before the holiday weekend traffic got to be too terrible. My car, unfortunately, had other plans.  The battery, which I had purchased less than a month prior, decided it didn't want to work.  We suspected it was a bad connection to the terminal but couldn't be sure. Instead of driving to Checker Auto, I decided to take the car a couple blocks away to Virginia Auto.  I have a few friends who regularly take their vehicles here for service, so even though I had never utilized their serviced, I felt confident about taking my car in.\\n\\nAt 8am, their small lot was already packed, and I snagged the only available spot.  We walked in and were helped right away.  The very nice lady at the desk asked if I'd made an appointment ahead of time and I explained our situation.  She said they had quite a few other cars in with appointments but she would see what she could do.  We sat inside the small lobby and chatted for a while before she came back in.  My brand new battery was dead.  It had been completely drained!  She said they could put the battery back in and we could go back to Checker to have it replaced or they could install a new battery for me.  Not wanting to take a chance on another bad battery, I decided to have them take care of it for me.  Not more than 20 minutes later, they had finished!  I wasn't thrilled about having to pay more than I wanted to, but it was worth every penny.  After we got to Texas that afternoon, my very car-savvy Dad looked at the  car and said the battery had been installed very well - it was in securely and everything had been cleaned up really well.\\n\\nI need some serious maintenance done on the car, and I will absolutely be taking it in to Virginia Auto.  As soon as I do, I have no doubt I'll be coming back to this review to change it from a 4-star to a 5-star review.\\n\\nThank you, thank you, thank you, Virginia Auto, for taking such great care of me and my car and allowing us to head out of town for a few days without worrying about my car!\",\n",

Two of us had the Beef Panang for dinner and our friend had the Salmon dish.  All were prepared very well.  The beef panang was a little different than I have had at many places here in town.  More curry & creamy coconut milk than the light broth based panang we have settled for at other places.  It was by far the best panang we have in Phoenix to date.  The beef was fork tender and the sauce flavor was over the top.  \\n\\nThe restaurant is very cozy and energetic.  It was 7:30 on a Thursday night and the inside was full, with only 1 table on the patio brave enough to weather the 100 degree heat.  Server was very friendly and attentive.  NA beverages were always kept full and she was all over refilling our glasses from the bottle of wine that had been ordered.  Big bonus points for the kitchen design.  It will not blow you away with tons of polished stainless steel and creative wall decor, but it is an open exhibition kitchen with about 10-12 seats at the bar that look in on the action.  Extremely rare to find in a Thai concept.  Love knowing who is cooking your food and that the kitchen is well kept.

I do realize I was eating outside in the desert though so I tried to let it go.\\n\\nThe service was pretty bad.  We had to ask for ice tea refills.  We had to ask for additional sweetner packets.

My husband ordered the wild boar.  He thought it was just okay.  I had the eggplant and tofu.  I asked them to add some thai pumpkin to it.  It was SUPER YUMMY.

Wifey told me that tonight was the Thai New Year and they were going to have live music and dancers, so I figured uck it why not.

The corn fritters were other worldly, totally killer, I really enjoyed the tofu and the veggie rolls. What a great way to open up the meal.\\n\\nFor our meals, we split the Seafood Panang which was shrimp, scallops, mussels, calamari and salmon in a spicy red coconut sauce.

The shrimp were sweet and succulent, the scallops cooked to utter perfection, the mussels were done the was they\\'re supposed to be not chewy, tender) and the salmon was something to slap my mama over. \\n\\nThe other dish we had to split was the Merry Mu (grilled pork served with coconut rice and carrot \"relish\"). The pork was perfectly seasoned sliced large pork pieces, the coconut rice was a sticky ball of semi sweet rice (not my bag, but I think some people would like it) and the carrot relish was more like a sweet carrot salad. It did come with this really peculiar (in a good way) green salty/bitter sauce that I kept going back to.

Loved it!\\n\\nWild wrap - Spicy chopped chicken with a mint-lime sauce served with cabbage leaves. This tasted so fresh. Yes, spicy but very refreshing at the same time.\\n\\nVeggie Spring Rolls - Tender and crispy rolls stuffed with fresh veggies, cellophane noodles and served with a great plum sauce. They really were tender yet crisp, hot, tasty and the veggies tasted so fresh you would think they had a garden out back. I looked for it but found nothing but parking lot.\\n\\nHot Pot:\\nWe also shared a Tom Yum Goong hot pot. The soup was nice and spicy, the shrimp was tender, the mushrooms had a rich earthy flavor and the lemongrass infused a wonderful aromatic hue to the soup.\\n\\nMain Course:\\nI had the Ginger Fish. This is a breaded piece of salmon topped with mushrooms, onions, carrots and pineapple with a ginger sauce along with fresh sauteed veggies and rice. The presentation was first-class and portion size was very generous . In fact, I ended up taking about half of it home.

Decorated with traditional Thai art; Wild Thaiger tries to emulate that Thailand feel along with your cuisine.  \\n\\nI've been here several times once for dinner and once for Happy Hour.  I'm a big fan of the fried noodles mainly Pad See Ew - Stir-fried fat noodles with your choice of protein; chicken, beef, or pork; and of course vegetables.  Seems pretty simple, but this dish packs a punch of aroma and spice.  It's usually fried in a garlic sauce and the amount of heat is based on how much you can handle.  I can't do the Thai spice I'll admit so I always do the medium.  In any case, Wild Thaiger deliveries with the Pad See Ew along with their traditional Pad Thai dish.  Another stir-fried noodle, but this one is with the skinny noodles and it's much sweeter.\\n\\nOverall, I would come here for Happy Hour because they have 1/2 off appetizers.

I asked for menu suggestions, the waiter just stared at me blankly. I asked if I could have steamed rice rather than fried, he said that was impossible to change. Impossible. Eventually our entrees came, I ordered soup, it wasn't good. He brought out a teacup for me to use as my soup bowl. It was almost impossible to manage. Then our check came, he overcharged us. I didn't dispute anything because I just wanted to leave. I paid in cash, he shorted me five dollars. I called that his tip, and left. \\nThe restaurant was not busy, it was typical for a Wednesday night. There is no excuse for their wait times or rudeness.

On occasion, I've seen some check-out mayhem, but for the most part they do a good job (during daylight hours anyway) of adding checkers when needed and are usually very helpful and pleasant (considering they're being paid minimum wage to do a job that you do yourself at Fresh & Easy or any supermarket on the east coast).\\n\\nI will say I was bummed today when I did 95% of my shopping only to get to the end and find that they had neither the brats, nor Italian sausage I was looking for and i had to make a double grocery excursion to hit up the ghetto Fry's on Thomas.\\n\\nI also have to give this Safeway props, b/c while my fave Starbucks (in the same shopping center) was being renovated, that S'buck's kiosk kept me amped in the AM.\",\n",
       " \"We just moved back into the hood from Anthem and man what a BUMMER this Safeway is. I LOVE LOVE LVE LVE LEV LOVE LOOOOVE Safeway. I will drive any distance to shop at a Safeway - what a bummer this is only 1/2 a mile from my house. \\n\\nWent last night and was utterly appalled at the mess of a store I walked into. The aisles were a disaster - product was thrown everywhere or was completely out. I thought this was a grocery store? A place to buy FOOD?\\n\\nOne checkout line open and a miserable employee ringing. If I wasn't in the middle of baking dessert at home I would have tossed the ingredients I needed back on the shelves and gotten the hell outta there. \\n\\nThank GOD the Safeway on Osborn is only a short ride away.\",\n",

Yeah, the produce is just ok, but isn't that why you shop at the Phoenix Public Market with its bushels and bushels of bountiful fresh produce?!\\n\\nThe customers...ugh.  I drive here because its easier then trying to carrying six bags at once.  When I drive, I allow those entering/leaving the store to pass in front of my car.  BUT if you are going to cross in front of my car do it with purpose.  Don't be checking your blackberry or dawdling. Move people!\\n\\nIf you are checking out, and have limited funds, double check the price of the celery before getting to the cashier.  Do not make the cashier leave his post so he has to veryify that the celery is $0.12 more expensive then you thought.  \\n\\nIf your bill is under $10 please try to pay with fewer then four debit/credit cards.\\n\\nIn summation:  shop, pay and get the hell out.\",\n",

The customers are an interesting mix.\",\n",

I think customer service is what really makes this place great. The guys at the deli counter are really nice. There is always somebody in the produce section. Every employee always asks if I need help. The cashiers are always nice ( Rodney and Mercedes). The baggers are always friendly too. Only complaints... I did see a bag of moldy beef jerky once\",\n",

That\\'s a good question. Several times I have had to grab a handbasket because there were no carts in stock, even though I had a long grocery list to fulfill. I actually saw the cartboys leaning against the cartrails, laughing and having a heck of a time. Look, I get it, it\\'s hot outside and you don\\'t want to get get the carts, but C\\'MON!\\n3) The first thing you see upon walking in may or may not be a ghetto display of moldy-looking fruit, or on  the 4th of July, a teenage employee roasting hot dogs on a bunsen burner with open containers of ketchup and mustard on a rickety table.\\n4) Venture into the produce section, and you will meander through very difficult twists and turns that your cart may not even fit through. Please, managers, make sure that the spaces between fruit stands are at least cart-width!!!\\n5) The line for the pharmacy extends into the produce area. Enough said.\\n6) Expect for the aisles to have large space-blocking cardboard displays and/or fallen down merchandise and/or an employee restocking items right in the middle of the day. I would say half of the aisles are blocked at any given time.\\n7) Once you have completed your hazardous journey of finding everything on your list, you must enter one of the two checkout lines, which are so long that they become another force blocking the aisleways. Two checkout lines, you say? Yes, only two, despite there being 5 or 6 total checkout lanes. If you are a young lady with any shred of fashion or hygiene, expect to be \"checked out\" by creepy older men whilst standing innocently in line.\\n8) Your cashier will either be a surly teenage boy or a pregnant teenage girl who does a poor job managing the line and barely gives you the time of day and/or forgets to give you the receipt when you are done. But you are so eager to get out of there, you simply don\\'t care to go back and ask for it.\\n\\nOh, and there may or may not be trash on the floor.\\nIf Safeway as a nationwide brand prides themselves on safety or service, they need to get their corporate people in here to take a look at this store, and either condemn it or fire everyone who works here.\\nIt\\'s even more pitiful because they are the closest store to everyone who lives downtown, so they could easily be the most popular.\\nPlease, downtown, replace this disgraceful store with a Whole Foods or a Sprouts or a place with a shred of human decency.',\n",

       " \"I was just  visiting Phoenix over the weekend for the Rock N Roll Marathon on  Jan. 14th. We were staying at the Hyatt Regency on 2nd Street & Monroe, walking distance from the Arizona Center that is blessed with Sam's Cafe! \\nI can be a demanding customer due to my dietary needs. I am always in need of altering my menu selection and substituting items. Sam's wait staff & chef were extremely accommodating to me. I had the Fish Tacos on Saturday night with a full serving of steamed vegetables instead of the rice & beans it usually comes with. They also gave me the Chipotle sauce on the side and plenty of salsa... (GOOD salsa)!\\nWe were so pleased with our meal & service that on our last night in town we opted to return to Sam's Cafe knowing we would be satisfied with our meals and the menu has alot of goodies to choose from. I had the Salmon this time on a bed of veggies instead of sweet potatoes. I did let myself indulge in some of their tasty and chips with the chunky & tasteful salsa, (I just ran a marathon)! The chips themselves are very unique mixture of blue corn tortilla, sweet potato chips, and some other varieties...GOOD! \\nI will return on any visit to Phoenix!!\",\n",
       " \"My husband and I live downtown, and Sam's has become one of our favorite regular spots (bonus that the AMC theater is right there, too!). The chips are great- a variety of veggie, tortilla, and won-ton chips mixed in one basket. The tortilla soup, quesadillas, and especially the carnitas plate are all highly recommended. The Orange Beso margarita is so delicious and so big we always split one. The seafood pasta was acceptable, which is almost high praise in Phoenix where most of the seafood we've had is downright nasty. We've never had room for dessert, but the white chocolate/pecan corn husk is the perfect little bit of sweet at the end of the meal. Prices are fair and the outdoor seating is cool, but can be a little loud when they are crowded and the waterfalls are running in the courtyard. The service has always been good to excellent.\",\n",
       " \"This restaurant closes their doors at 10pm SHARP!! My mom and I arrived at the restaurant at 10pm. The hostess planned to close the restaurant. Thank you Manager of the restaurant for letting us stay!!\\n\\nWe basically had 5 minutes to look at the menu. Our waitress wanted us out ASAP. I didn't look at the menu carefully so I just picked something out of the Specialty section. \\n\\nAnyway, the chips and salsa were awesome!!! Our basket of chips had three varieties: corn tortilla, blue corn tortilla, and a sweet and spicy chip. I really liked the sweet and spicy chip since it tasted like a slightly spicy churro. Yum!  The salsa had a black bean flavor and chunks of tomatoes. Also yummy.\\n\\nThe food came out so quickly!! It took like 10 minutes for the food to come out. Haha.\\n\\nI had the Santa Fe Stuffed Chicken Breast. mMmMM.. the stuffing was so good!! I loved the herb-goat cheese mixed with the red pepper cream sauce and the cilantro pesto. The chicken was very moist! The asparagus wasn't too good, as it was chewy. However, the southwest rice pilaf was so creamy and had a smoky flavor. I also loved the extra touch of the tortilla chips on top of the dish. Lovely presentation!\\n\\nMy mom had the Chicken Penne Pasta with the cilantro pesto. The chicken was moist, and the pesto had a deep cilantro flavor. If you hate cilantro, stay away from this dish!! There was a tad bit too much olive oil, but the strong cilantro flavor was awesome!\\n\\nIt was a pleasant surprise to receive a frozen white chocolate tamale. YUMMY! I only eat white chocolate so I was so excited to eat this. Loved the nuts and the sweetness. \\n\\nAgain, our waitress was not very nice to us. So I'm taking off a point for the service.\\n\\nWe were out the door by 10:40pm.\",\n",
       " 'My two-star rating for Sam\\'s Cafe is based on our experience there for happy hour in the bar. If we ever return for dinner, I will update, but for now, I\\'ll just say this place is really unremarkable and disappointing and that there are *way* better places to go for happy hour. \\n\\nWe went for happy hour on Friday around 5:45 pm and sat in the bar at one of the high tables. There were only 3-4 other people in the bar area, (and maybe 6-8 in the rest of the restaurant) but it still took the bartender about 5 minutes to come over and take our drink order. I got the Grand Canyon Margarita (featuring cranberry and citrus juices), and my husband got the Cactus Margarita (basically the house margarita). Both were $3. We wanted to order some bar food as well, but again, it took him about 10 minutes to return with our drinks and take our food order, even though the bar was still quite empty. After already being irritable with the slow service (having both worked in restaurants, we are very understanding of how stressful it is to handle a lot of tables or drink orders, but the restaurant was so empty that there was just no excuse), the slow service was not the only bad part of our first experience at Sam\\'s Cafe. \\n\\nThe next negative was that the margaritas were so sweet and weak, they might as well just have charged us $3 each for juice. Then, it took another 15-20 minutes for us to get our bar food (carnitas cheese crisp, jalapeno poppers, and southwestern bruschetta) and when it finally came, it was all cold! We noticed that no one else in the bar area had gotten food, but all of a sudden, the bartender emerged from the back with an enormous tray of food and served everyone who had been waiting for food at once. Having worked in many restaurants, I know that one of the main rules of good service is that someone should take food out as soon as it\\'s ready so that it doesn\\'t get cold, and that as a server, I was responsible for doing so even if the food wasn\\'t for my table. Either the bartender should have been checking in the back more frequently for food that was ready or someone else (like the manager, who kept wandering around in a daze but never appeared to be doing much) should have done him a favor (if he was really that busy) and brought it out. \\n\\nThe third negative was that most of the food was not good at all. I know not to expect too much from bar food, especially when it was seriously discounted for happy hour, but two of the things we ordered were just bad. The carnitas cheese crisp was not light and crispy with gooey cheese; instead, it was a heavy and greasy flour tortillas covered in congealed cheese and dry shredded pork. Not good. The jalapeno poppers and boneless chicken wings were also terrible - Jack in the Box has better poppers and the chicken wings were straight out of a Tyson resealable bag. The Southwestern Bruschetta was fine, although it was very oily, and I have a hard time understanding how merely adding a ton of cilantro to a tomato mix makes something \"southwestern.\" None of the food items was more than $5, but I have been to *many* other happy hours where you can get solid, flavorful appetizers for between $2 - $5. Kincaid\\'s and McCormick & Schmick\\'s are two great examples. \\n\\nThe final kicker of our bad happy hour experience was when we asked the bartender for a check and he tried to pressure us to order more even though we said several times that we were finished. I believe the exact line was, \"Are you sure you don\\'t want anything else? More drinks? More food? Some shots?\" Maybe I\\'m crazy, but I don\\'t think you should order more to *make* your experience somewhere better; rather, you should order more *because* you\\'re having such a good time. As persuasive as his \"selling techniques\" were, we weren\\'t (having a good time), so we didn\\'t (order more).',\n",
       " \"I really enjoyed this place. I had some great grilled tuna with rice and veggies. It was cooked perfectly and the seasonings didn't overwhelm the tuna. Everyone else at the table got more traditional mexican dishes...tacos, fajitas etc. and they really seemed to enjoy them! I also had an AMAZING margarita. It was a specialty one with citrus flavors, I don't even like tequila but it was delicious. The outdoor seating area is beautiful. We ate surrounded by trees covered in twinkle lights, so pretty.\",\n",
       " \"After reading all the other reviews of this place I have determined one thing. You all were obviously on crack when you ate here. Or maybe they gave you crack when you ate here...either way my experience was not the same.\\n\\nWent at about 4:00 on a Saturday, not a busy time for a restaurant so I wasn't scared away when we were the only ones in the entire place, next time, I'll make sure to think twice.\\n\\nThey started us off with chips and salsa, and I'm rather shocked that no one has mentioned their chips are a total fail. Salsa was decent, but the chips were an assortment of sweet potato chips, stale blue corn chips, sweet fried chips (sugar and everything), and stale normal tortilla chips. All in one bowl. If they weren't stale, the blue corn and normal chips would have paired nicely with the salsa. But rubbery sweet potato (don't get me wrong, I like sweet potato)  and sugar coated with salsa? Really?\\n\\nWe decided that we were going to order an appetizer and then a meal to split, and I love a good artichoke-anything so I ordered the artichoke dip. When it came out (like 20 minutes later) I had to ask them if they brought us the right dish. It was a bowl of queso and no matter how hard I searched, there was not an artichoke to be found. They didn't bring us any other chips to go with it, and let me tell you, sweet potato chips and queso don't go so great together. To make it worse, the menu said it was $6.99 but they charged us $7.79, if it was good I wouldn't have cared so much about $0.80 as I do.\\n\\nI thought a good beef fajita dish with a cup of chicken tortilla soup would be a safe bet, but they couldn't even do that right. They brought out corn and flour tortillas with the fajitas. Word of advice, if they ask you which you prefer save yourself the trouble and get the flour. The corn ones were so wet that they literally tore to shreds when I tried to peel them off each other. There wasn't a whole lot of beef in the beef fajitas either, and what was there was lacking in good flavor. And for the soup, Half Moon Sports Grill makes a better tortilla soup than this place...and they're a sports grill. \\n\\nOverall, food was bad. Service was very slow considering we were the only ones there, and I would never, ever eat here again. Did I mention they didn't give us silverware? We had to go steal it off another table.\",\n",
       " 'Had a nice dinner outside on the patio - it was really pretty. The margaritas were pretty good. The salsa and chips were also pretty tasty - it was nice to have some variety- these were no simple white corn chips; there were blue corn and even sweet potato chips mixed in.

The salsa is gringalicious (not spicy at all,  but still pretty tasty).\\n\\nWe started with the sampler (probably a mistake for only 2 people as it was huge) it had mushroom quesadilla, spring rolls, turkey sliders and a salad. It was pretty good, but would have been better for a group of 6.\\n\\nI ordered the steak and cake for my main. It was a chile-rubbed sirloin accompanied by a big fat delicious crab cake.

       " \"I started out extremely hopeful because the basket of chips placed on the table were so good that I probably would have been satisfied not ordering an actual entree. As it turned our, I should have listened to my stomach. The basket of chips included blue corn, yellow corn, sweet potato and surprisingly the best of the bunch, fried won ton skins with Navajo spices. The salsa was pretty good though when my friend asked for something spicier, all they did was dump some cayenne pepper into the same salsa and serve it in a different shaped bowl.\\n\\nWe started with the cheap happy hour margarita, which was better than expected to their special Commemorativo margarita, which was served to us in the shaker. For the price, it was a lot of margarita with a lot of tequila and it was tasty. Can't beat that...except maybe with a couple of rounds of Patron.\\n\\n I knew I was in trouble, though, when I asked the waiter to recommend a vegetarian dish and he suggested the veggie pasta with black beans and ginger soy sauce. Not sure why I listened to him when every part of my being told me not to order pasta at a Mexican restaurant. But I did. My pasta came with three toothpick thin pieces of asparagus, one mushroom, two pieces of zucchini and a little pile of spinach. There were a few black beans hiding in the noodles which were slightly tinted brown, supposedly the Ginger soy sauce. It was the worst meal I have had in a very longtime and a total disappointment to say the least. I tried a piece of my friend's tuna and it was overbooked, try and bland.\\n\\nAll in all, this place got one star for their margaritas and one star for their chips. I may go back for drinks but will think twice, and probably even three times before I eat there again.\",\n",

They brought out chips and salsa that were actually very tasty. The chips are brushed with some sort of chipotle spice and served with chipotle salsa as well.\\n\\nFor my meal, I ordered the chicken fajitas which were decent, but nothing to write home about. All of the portions were pretty large, but I still felt that the prices were a bit high considering the quality of food.\\n\\nThe service was friendly and relatively speedy and they even gave us a little palette cleansing dessert to complete the meal.\\n\\nOverall, this place is a good place to get your fix for margaritas and Mexican food in Phoenix, but just be prepared to pay a little higher price than you are probably used to.',\n",

       " 'Canyon Cafe has the potential to be an idyllic restaurant, but falls short on nearly all aspects one desires in a dining experience. I want this place to succeed, I really do, but based upon a couple of my experiences here it seems they themselves do not want to succeed.\\n\\nCanyon Cafe has a really nice location in downtown Phoenix at the Arizona Center. One of its main selling points is the huge shaded patio overlooking the Arizona Center courtyard with tall palm trees and soothing waterfalls. They have some of the best margaritas I\\'ve ever tasted. The food is mediocre.\\n\\nMy first three times here last winter were great. Canyon Cafe was one of my first restaurant experiences in Phoenix, as I had just accepted my first big boy job and had relocated from Pennsylvania. I was in love with the new climate and the countless varieties of margaritas. The food was so-so, but the atmosphere and service received were wonderful. My server was the older lady with shorter gray hair--perfect! \\n\\nMy fourth time was on a Friday night, and we arrived to a surprisingly empty restaurant around 8:30 for dinner. The chile-rubbed sirloin left a lot to be desired, but the Orange Beso margaritas were its saving grace. I really love these margaritas, and I highly recommend this place for margaritas, and margaritas only, but only if you want to stop drinking them by 10pm on a Friday night. I didn\\'t know they closed at 10pm on a Friday night until the server presented me the check at 10pm saying that they close at 10pm on Friday nights. Seriously? I\\'m not one to consciously stay past closing time, but giving one of your few remaining repeat customers the proverbial \\'foot in the ass\\' is probably a big reason as to why you have no one in your restaurant on a Friday night. That, and you don\\'t have a HH to lure customers in earlier in the evening. Get with the program.\\n\\nIn the spirit of redemption, I came here solo for a late lunch yesterday. The place was nearly empty, but that\\'s to be expected at 4pm on a weekday. I picked a nice patio table overlooking the courtyard on an absolutely beautiful 80 degree day. I sipped on my Blue Moon margarita, wayfarers on, giving thanks I wasn\\'t in the torrent of shit that was unloading on the east coast. I ordered the Salmon Caesar Salad and went back to sipping and basking. Five minutes later my waitress returns asking me what I ordered. Sip.\\n\\nThis particular Caesar salad has apple and pear slices in it, which sounded deliciously refreshing. I was let down when the bowl arrived and the pieces were about the width of a toothpick. The salad and dressing were great, but the salmon tasted too fishy, leading me to believe it was old. \\n\\nI\\'m about halfway finished with my margarita when my server drops the check, not even asking me if i\\'d like another margarita. There are literally three tables in the entire restaurant and I feel like I\\'m being rushed out again. I don\\'t touch the check, but proceed to sip, people watch, and check my phone to see how the market did. Ten minutes later she opens the check presenter that\\'s on my table,\\n\\n\"Oh, you\\'re not finished?\"\\n    No.\\n\"Just enjoying the weather?\"\\n    ..........\\n\\nI think I\\'m finished now. I\\'m finished with this restaurant. This place is a headache. Also check out their website. It looks like something I could have created using Visual Basic in high school.

It depicts the Navajo Creation Story and is intricate and beautiful.\\n\\n- The Hopi Wedding Dress inside the Homelands Exhibit\\n\\n- The Photograph of the Grave yard outside the Indian School in the Boarding School Experience. \\n\\n- The Statue of Native women outside the museum. \\n\\n- The Yazzie Mural inside the We Are exhibit.

Ask to know the meaning of symbols and designs. Know what materials they\\'re made out of! \\n\\nThere could be two bracelets that almost identical and one could be silver plated and one could be solid silver.

Even those have to come from a Native-owned and operated establishment.

We are often objectified and practically forced to share that which is sacred to us. But it\\'s allowed and it\\'s a choice that each Native artist that has dealt with has the Heard made for themselves. \\n\\nThere is an unequal representation of Tribes on display at the Heard, the Navajo exhibit is HUGE at the Heard and yet the O\\'odham exhibit is medium sized. Even though O\\'odhams have contributed over $1,000,000.00 to the museum. We don\\'t complain, atleast our ways are being shared right? And it\\'s nice to take children to the museum and see their little eyes light up when they see things that reminds them of home. And the Boarding School Exhibit opens MANY eyes to the history that existed just a few blocks north. This slices through me and I\\'m so grateful this piece of history is no longer being ignored.\\n\\nLike I said - it\\'s a love/hate relationship. I love the Heard because they give opportunities to Native Artists and share our culture as sensitively as possible. But it\\'s an uphill battle to be deemed good enough to be one of those artists and people who shares our culture. I know of many great people who I personally feel should be \"let in\" be denied and my heart goes out to them. I love that Natives still get in for free but I hate that the Heard treats AZ tribes like we\\'re obligated to help them to keep their lights on. I love that all the tribes in Arizona have been given the oppurtunity to share a piece of their culture yet I hate that the museum focuses on two tribes.\\n\\nTo my yelpers: Please realize that each tribe has it\\'s own ways and unique culture.

We had an excellent tour guide who was part Navajo and part Hopi. In addition to giving us a broad overview of Native American history, he also gave us many insights into growing up on a reservation and cultural traditions. As we toured through the galleries filled with basketry, ceramics, and Navajo blankets, he explained that a lot of the names \"given\" to the tribes by white settlers were simply the result of the two groups not understanding one another. For instance, the Pima tribe is so called because in response to the question, \"What are you called?\" the people answered, \"Pima,\" which means \"I don\\'t know\"--as in, I don\\'t know what you crazy people are asking me!\\n\\nMy friend and I had a wonderful time, and I would definitely recommend visiting if you\\'re ever in Phoenix.',\n",

Interactive. The Heard created great displays with information and an interactive game for children...or children at heart. \\n\\n2. Visual dessert for the eyes. They don\\'t cheat you on historical artifact exhibits which shows that they have a nice group of donors who are eager to keep the museum alive and visually stimulating. \\n\\n3. Family-fun for everyone. I saw a brochure marketing family-fun days every Saturday in July. Activities include, interactive games, crafts, live performances, etc. \\n\\n4. AZ Resident Friendly. The admission price was $12 and I cringed a little, but then as if I was meant to get a little cultured that day, they told me that AZ residents receive free admission every second Sunday of the month. Not a bad way to take care of the residents melting in the heat! \\n\\n5. Cafe food you actually want to eat. To make the most of the day, I ate at the cafe and took advantage of the 85 degree weather while it still lasted. The food...was good. I had a warm turkey and brie sandwich on homemade cranberry bread with the corn pasta salad.

They need to provide some sort of microphone system for the docents to speak to their tours; they are available.  The first docent who, I discovered later, is new and still in training, had a problem with her speed.  She would start explaining about a particular room or exhibit before the entire group was within hearing distance--and about the time the last people came near enough to hear her, she was off to the next exhibit.  \\n\\nPhotography is allowed in the museum; however, some of the exhibits and explanatory walls are covered with a reflective glass or plex which reflects the light from behind, making photography difficult.\\n\\nThe prices in the sit-down restaurant are very very very expensive - They are quite appropriate for a dinner, but for a lunch at a venue which is pricey to enter in the first place, an overpriced sandwich isn't appropriate.  Even the hot dog combo in the cantina was $7!  Why does every facility of this type add to the cost of the enjoyment of the place by offering overpriced food?\\n\\nThe building and grounds are gorgeous, and quite an oasis in the middle of a busy city.

As you stroll through the museum to see the displays and read a bit about the history you can't help but put yourself in the time period and imagine what life must have been like.\\n\\nIf you're visiting the Phoenix area from a location that doesn't have something like the Heard and you want to go home with some knowledge of Native American and Southwest art I highly recommend a visit to Heard.\",\n",

The blue cheese is really good, and the buns they use are like the Hawaiian dinner rolls everyone eats at Thanksgiving.... The meat is really good too. my favorite burger now. Check my other posts to see that I don't say that about everything.\",\n",

I was going to Dr. Johnson before he left and Goldberg took over when Johnson left. He is not a caring doctor. He is only interested in the co-pay and having you come in for medication refills every month. He will not give refills and could less about patients's financial situations. Trying to get your 90 days mail away pharmacy prescriptions through this guy is a joke. And to make matters even worse, his office staff is incompetent. 90% of the time when you call the office, they'll put you through to a voice mail, that NO ONE ever answers or returns your call. Both my adult children and husband have decided to leave this practice after experiencing such frustration. The entire office has an attitude like they are doing you a favor. Give me a break! Stay away from this doc and the practice. You deserve better and they will not be there when you really need them. I have never felt compelled to write a bad review about anyone until I met this pathetic excuse for a doctor who is all about the money.\",\n",

But for the new year - the special was all-you-can-eat pancakes for $2.12, I added a breakfast sausage patty ($3.00).  Father had the typical, two eggs, toast, hash-bowns (seem fresh cut), sausage links.  Food was tasty, no major qualms other than - the hash-browns need a bit more cooking and the coffee needs a bit more bite.\\n\\nvery nice assortment of bakes goods - massive - as large as your head cream-puffs, eclairs - I took a blueberry muffin to go - which I enjoyed.  \\n\\nQuick exit from I-94...just northeast of  Madison',\n",

However, their pastries won my over.  Try it all!  The pie was delicious.  I went with a simple apple selection.  Delicious, perfection.  It is nothing crazy, no fancy name but truthfully one of the best piece of classic apple you can find around here.  \\n\\nThe service is a little slow but once again, it is a small restaurant with lots of charm.
